# Assemble Communication Runtime

Use this skill when turning reusable communication capabilities into the deterministic worker system that actually runs the service.

## Core Responsibilities

`Oranguru` owns:

- runtime workflow composition
- internal runtime data contracts
- candidate generation and reduction
- scoring and hourly slotting
- allocation and output artifacts
- runtime validation and rollout rules

## Required Inputs

Before assembling the runtime, make sure these capability contracts exist:

- audience handoff from `xatu`
- template inventory contract from `wigglytuff`
- communication activity contract from `chatot`

The runtime should consume those contracts rather than silently redefining them.

## Runtime Reference

For the current SMS service, start with `reference/current-solver-parity.md`.

## Boundaries

`Oranguru` does not own:

- template authoring or template sync
- upstream hard-filter ownership
- provider-specific delivery lifecycle ownership
- top-level builder ontology and golden-prompt governance

Those belong to `manage-channel-templates`, `xatu`, `chatot`, or the repo-owned service builder prompt.

## Checklist

Before considering the runtime-assembly capability ready, confirm:

- runtime boundaries are explicit
- internal runtime contracts are explicit
- candidate generation and allocation phases are documented
- output artifacts are documented
- retries, replay, and recovery are defined
- the runtime can be rebuilt from the stored prompt and worker contracts without hidden tribal knowledge
