# Connect Service — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Authoritative blueprint for building the **Connect** partner-integration service. It captures the full feature set, data contracts, runtime behaviour, and infrastructure topology that the service must enforce. The implementation language is **TypeScript everywhere**; infrastructure is **AWS CDK only**, deployed to the installer-supplied tenant AWS region, per the Golden Path engineering standards.

---

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Mission

Connect is a serverless partner-integration platform that fronts every external data partner (Plaid, Argyle, Atomic, AVMs, credit bureaus, lenders, …) behind a single REST API. It hides the complexity of each partner's quirks (authentication, content type, polling, webhooks, widgets, static-IP allow-listing, multipart payloads, OAuth refresh, etc.) behind one declarative **flow specification** that the platform compiles into an AWS Step Functions state machine and exposes as `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/{entity}/{name}/jobs`.

**AWS Step Functions is the single, canonical implementation layer for every Connect workflow.** Every flow and lookup compiles to a Step Functions state machine; there is no "alternative runtime" — no Lambda-only orchestrator, no in-process workflow engine, no SQS-chained worker fan-out. Branching, looping, error handling, retries, parallelism, timeouts, fan-out, and human-in-the-loop waits are expressed exclusively as native ASL constructs (`Choice`, `Map`, `Parallel`, `Retry`, `Catch`, `Wait`, `Wait For Task Token`).

**Outbound HTTP calls to partners are issued by Step Functions itself when the response is contractually inline-small.** Connect uses the native Step Functions **HTTP Task** integration (`arn:aws:states:::http:invoke`) backed by **EventBridge `Connection` resources** for credential storage when the compiled state can prove the response body will stay under the Step Functions payload boundary. Lambda workers are reserved for the HTTP cases the native integration cannot express safely: multipart streaming, blob upload from a presigned source, raw binary file download to S3, static-IP-bound egress through the on-demand NAT, XML envelope rewrites that require code, and any partner response that must be streamed directly to `VendorsResponsesBucket` instead of crossing the Step Functions state boundary.

### 1.2 Primary user surface

A single **AWS API Gateway REST API** mounted at `https://<subdomain>/connector-jobs/`*, API-key authorised (`x-api-key` per usage plan), with the capability groups below (full mapping in §3 and §4):


| Group                                  | Routes                                                                                                                                        | Purpose                                                                                                     |

Each successful POST that mints work returns `202 Accepted` with a server-generated `creation_id`, `job_id`, or `batch_execution_id`. Every mutating route is API-key-gated (`api_key_required: true`) plus CORS preflight; the only exceptions are `POST /…/webhook` (partner-authenticated via per-flow secret) and `GET /information` (mock).

### 1.3 Non-goals

- Connect does **not** persist partner response bodies long-term; it stages them in S3 with a 30-day lifecycle.
- Connect does **not** own partner contracts. Partners' OpenAPI shapes are encoded in the flow spec authored by the integrator.
- Connect does **not** synthesise its own subdomain or ACM certificates. The `Subdomain` parameter is provided by the deployer.
- Connect does **not** invent its own auth identity. API keys are minted upstream; Bootstrap creates the tenant's single shared Usage Plan and binds the service key to it. Connect only attaches its API stage to that shared plan.
- Connect does **not** broker SOAP envelopes natively — XML traffic is supported as a transport, not as a schema.
- Connect does **not** host arbitrary user-supplied code. Partners that need transformation logic do it in their own service or via flow primitives (`Pass`, `Choice`, `JSONPath`-driven request mapping).
- Connect does **not** open raw outbound SSH from Lambda. SFTP traffic goes exclusively through **AWS Transfer Family Connectors** with the listing-first poller flow (see §2.3.7 and §5.6).

## 2. Architecture

### 2.0 Architectural principles (non-negotiable)

These principles anchor every other section and override any conflicting design choice elsewhere in the codebase.

1. **Step Functions is the workflow implementation layer.** Every flow and lookup compiles to a Step Functions state machine (STANDARD for flows, EXPRESS for lookups). There is no second workflow runtime, no in-Lambda step orchestrator, no chained-SQS state machine. Branching (`Choice`), looping (`Map`), parallelism (`Parallel`), retries (`Retry`), error catches (`Catch`), waits (`Wait`), and human-in-the-loop pauses (`waitForTaskToken`) are expressed exclusively as ASL primitives.
2. **Step Functions issues inline-small outbound HTTP itself.** Native Step Functions **HTTP Tasks** (`arn:aws:states:::http:invoke`) backed by EventBridge `Connection` resources are the default transport only when the flow spec declares `ResponseMode: "INLINE"` and `MaxResponseBytes <= RUNTIME_HTTP_TASK_MAX_INLINE_RESPONSE_BYTES`. Lambda HTTP workers exist for cases the native integration cannot express safely (multipart streaming, blob upload from a presigned source, raw binary file download to S3, static-IP-bound egress, XML envelope code-driven rewrites, and `ResponseMode: "S3"` / `SaveResponseToFile=true` large-response staging). The compiler must decide this before emitting ASL; it must never append an `s3:putObject` task after a native HTTP Task to rescue an already-oversized response.
3. **Authorisation lives on the EventBridge Connection, not in code.** Basic, API-key, and OAuth2 client-credentials flows are configured on the EventBridge `Connection`. The compiled state machine never sees the secret material — it only references the Connection ARN. Token rotation is delegated to EventBridge for OAuth2 connections; the central token registry (`TokensTable`) remains the source of truth for partners that need cross-flow token reuse outside EventBridge's native OAuth2 support.
4. **AWS-native integrations beat custom code.** Where Step Functions has a first-class service integration (`states:startExecution.sync:2`, `s3:getObject`, `dynamodb:GetItem`, `aws-sdk:dynamodb:putItem.waitForTaskToken`, `lambda:invoke`, `events:putEvents`, `transfer:StartFileTransfer` via Lambda for SFTP), the compiler emits the integration directly. Custom Lambdas exist only when no AWS-native integration suffices.
5. **No in-process workflow engine, no in-process SSH client, no in-process code sandbox.** These exclusions remain enforced (see §7.6 and §2.5).

### 2.1 Stacks (AWS CDK)

The CDK app is composed of two stacks deployed in order:

```
bin/app.ts
├── NetworkStack    # VPC + 2 private app subnets + Lambda SG +
│                    # the on-demand Static-IP fabric (Internet GW, public subnet,
│                    # EIP, NAT GW, two private routes) provisioned by Step Functions
└── ConnectStack    # All Lambdas, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, KMS CMK,
                    # Step Functions, REST API + IAM authorisers, API Gateway custom
                    # resources, OpenAPI spec, dynamic /proxy-links/* fabric,
                    # SFTP runtime APIs + listing-first poller
```

`ConnectStack.addDependency(networkStack)` ensures the network deploys first. Both stacks are declared in **TypeScript** with AWS CDK v2 and deployed exclusively via `cdk deploy`. No Serverless Framework, SAM, Terraform, Pulumi, raw CloudFormation, or other IaC tools are permitted (per §`cloud-aws-primary`).

### 2.2 NetworkStack contents

- **VPC** with `maxAzs: 2`, `natGateways: 0` (the static-IP NAT is provisioned on demand by `EnableStaticIp`), two subnet tiers (`public`, `app=PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS` reserved for static-IP-bound Lambdas), and an S3 gateway endpoint reachable from `app`.
- **VPC Flow Logs** (`ALL` traffic) into a 1-day-retention CloudWatch Logs group.
- One **Security Group**:
  - `LambdaSg` — `allowAllOutbound: true`, attached to every VPC-bound Lambda that needs to egress through the static IP.
- **Static-IP fabric scaffolding**: the two Step Functions (`EnableStaticIp` / `DisableStaticIp`), their backing Lambdas, and the IAM role they assume are all declared in NetworkStack but **the EIP, NAT Gateway, public subnet, and routes are created and destroyed at runtime** by those state machines (so cost is zero when no partner needs allow-listing).
- All resources carry `sc:service:name=connect` and `sc:product:name=Connect` cost tags (per `cloud-aws-primary`).

Stack outputs (re-exported at the application level): `VpcId`, `LambdaSgId`, `PrivateSubnetIds`, `EnableStaticIpStateMachineArn`, `DisableStaticIpStateMachineArn`.

All buckets enforce `BLOCK_ALL` public access, SSL-only, and `BUCKET_OWNER_ENFORCED` ownership.

#### 2.3.2 Queues


Connect currently provisions no SQS queues. Webhook task-token registration is synchronous: compiled `WAIT_FOR_TASK_TOKEN` states write their `REQUEST#<request_id>` rows directly to `FlowsTable` with the Step Functions AWS SDK DynamoDB callback integration before the execution starts waiting for the partner callback.

#### 2.3.3 DynamoDB

Both tables use `PAY_PER_REQUEST`, KMS-CMK SSE (`DataKey`), Point-In-Time Recovery enabled, and TTL on `ttlEpochSeconds` for transient rows.


| Table         | Keys                | Indexes                                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FlowsTable`  | `pk` (S) / `sk` (S) | `gsi1: type / vendor_name`, `gsi2: gsi2pk` | Single-table store for partners, flows, lookups, partner connectivity configurations, webhook references, and non-blocking webhook dedup rows. Item shape mirrors §6.4 / §6.5 / §6.7. |
| `TokensTable` | `pk` (S) / `sk` (S) | —                                          | Centralised token registry. Stores `token_value` (encrypted via the same CMK) plus an arbitrary `extra` map.                                                                   |


A single AWS-KMS Customer-Managed Key (`DataKey`) encrypts both tables and is granted `kms:Decrypt`/`kms:Encrypt` for the runtime Lambda role, scoped via `kms:ViaService=dynamodb.<region>.amazonaws.com`.

#### 2.3.4 Compute

All Lambdas are `NodejsFunction` with `runtime=NODEJS_24_X`, `architecture=ARM_64`, ESM bundling (`format: ESM`, `target: node24`, `mainFields: ["module", "main"]`, `--conditions module`), and the standard ESM `createRequire` banner so any CommonJS dependency can satisfy dynamic built-in `require`s. Logging format is JSON with three-month CloudWatch log-group retention. Handlers use `**@aws-lambda-powertools/{logger,tracer,metrics}`** with `POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME=connect-*`, `POWERTOOLS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO`, `POWERTOOLS_METRICS_NAMESPACE=connect` (per `observability-logging-tracing`).

**HTTP-by-default is Step Functions-native only for inline-small responses.** Per §2.0 principle 2, the flow compiler emits a native Step Functions HTTP Task (`arn:aws:states:::http:invoke`) for plain HTTP-shaped task types only when the task contract declares `ResponseMode: "INLINE"` and a `MaxResponseBytes` value at or below `RUNTIME_HTTP_TASK_MAX_INLINE_RESPONSE_BYTES`. Authorisation is bound to the EventBridge `Connection` resource referenced by the task; the runtime state machine never sees the credential material. Lambda workers in the **vendor request workers** cohort handle the residual HTTP cases the native HTTP Task integration cannot express end-to-end (multipart streaming, blob upload from a presigned source, raw binary file download to S3), **static-IP-bound egress** that must traverse the on-demand NAT, and response-to-S3 streaming for unknown or large partner bodies.

There are seven cohorts; the full per-task-type worker matrix lives in §3.5.1.

#### 2.3.5 Routing fabric

- **REST API** (`RestApi` `ConnectApi`) with default stage `${stage}`, regional endpoint type, CORS pre-flight for `*`, binary media types `multipart/form-data`, and a dedicated access log group. Routes:
  - All public paths in §1.2 → `LambdaIntegration(ConnectHandler)` with `apiKeyRequired: true`.
  - `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/webhook` → `LambdaIntegration(ConnectHandler)` with `apiKeyRequired: false` (partner-authenticated via the per-flow secret).
  - `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp/test-connection` → `LambdaIntegration(ConnectHandler)` with `apiKeyRequired: true`. Triggers a single `SftpPoller` listing for the partner's connector and returns `{ listingId, listingS3Uri, fileCount, sampledFiles[], errors[] }`. This is the manual invocation path required by `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Phase 5.
  - `GET /information` → `MOCK` integration returning the deployer-supplied `ServiceInfo` JSON.
  - `/proxy-links/{...}` → minted at runtime by `CreateProxyLinkWorker` (302 redirect to a partner-supplied or S3-presigned URL); torn down by `CleanupApigwWorker` at the end of the flow.
  - `GatewayResponse` rules normalise `INVALID_API_KEY`, `BAD_REQUEST_BODY`, `BAD_REQUEST_PARAMETERS`, and `DEFAULT_4XX` per §3.1.
- **API Gateway custom domain mapping** under base path `connector-jobs` against the Bootstrap-created tenant custom domain passed by Deployer (`AWS::ApiGateway::BasePathMapping` for the REST API). Connect must not create the shared API Gateway `DomainName`.
- **Step Functions** state machines (six, all `tracingEnabled: true`):
  - `FlowCreationStateMachine` (`STANDARD`) — compile + register a runtime `STANDARD` SFN per flow.
  - `LookupCreationStateMachine` (`STANDARD`) — compile + register a runtime `EXPRESS` SFN per lookup.
  - `FlowDecoratorStateMachine` (`STANDARD`, `WAIT_FOR_FLOW_INVOCATION_SFN`) — wraps each runtime flow execution with health-metric + reply-back-error-backup post-processing.
  - `InvocationPollerStateMachine` (`STANDARD`) — optional caller-side server-side polling loop.
  - `BatchInvocationStateMachine` (`STANDARD`) — Distributed Map (`Mode: DISTRIBUTED`, `ExecutionType: STANDARD`) over a JSON-array S3 object.
  - `EnableStaticIpStateMachine` / `DisableStaticIpStateMachine` (`STANDARD`) — idempotent EIP / NAT provisioning.
  The **runtime** state machines created by `CreateRuntimeStateMachine` / `UpdateRuntimeStateMachine` are dynamic, named `<product?>-<vendor>-<flow>[-<token>]`, and use a constrained `RuntimeStateMachineRole` whose policies are: `lambda:InvokeFunction` on the residual worker ARNs (including `SftpPoller` and the static-IP HTTP workers), `dynamodb:PutItem` on `FlowsTable` for synchronous webhook task-token rows, `**states:InvokeHTTPEndpoint`** on the runtime state-machine ARN itself (constrained per §2.3.6), and `**events:RetrieveConnectionCredentials**` + the matching `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the EventBridge connection-managed secret ARNs for the partners the flow targets.
- **EventBridge Connections** (`AWS::Events::Connection`, one per partner-auth-profile) hold the credential material for native Step Functions HTTP Tasks. Each connection encodes one of `BASIC` (username/password), `API_KEY` (header name + value), or `OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` (`AuthorizationEndpoint`, `ClientID`, `ClientSecret`, optional `HttpMethod`, optional `OAuthHttpParameters` for body/query/headers). Connection naming is deterministic: `connect-<vendor_name>[-<product_name>][-<auth_profile>]`. Connection ARNs are stored on the partner row (`eventbridge_connection_arns: Record<auth_profile, arn>`) and the compiler stamps the matching ARN onto every native HTTP Task it emits.
- **EventBridge Scheduler** group `connect-sftp-schedules` is created by the Connect stack, but partner schedules are created/updated/deleted at runtime by the SFTP configuration routes. Each schedule's target is `SftpPoller` with a static input event matching §6.7.

#### 2.3.6 IAM (high-level)

- The provider role is **never** wildcarded. Per-Lambda roles use `cdk.aws_iam.Grant.addToPrincipal` so each worker holds only the permissions it needs.
- The `ConnectHandler` role has: `dynamodb:{Get,Put,Update,Delete,Query,DescribeTable}Item` on `FlowsTable` + `TokensTable`, `kms:{Encrypt,Decrypt,GenerateDataKey,DescribeKey}` on `DataKey`, `s3:{PutObject,GetObject,ListObjectsV2,ListBucket}` on `VendorsResponsesBucket`, `states:{StartExecution,DescribeExecution,GetExecutionHistory,StartSyncExecution,StopExecution,RedriveExecution,ListExecutions,ListMapRuns,DescribeMapRun,DeleteStateMachine}` on the relevant ARN prefixes, `events:{CreateConnection,UpdateConnection,DescribeConnection,DeleteConnection}` scoped to `arn:aws:events:<region>:<account>:connection/connect-*` (so the credential-management routes can mint and rotate the per-partner Connections that back native HTTP Tasks), `transfer:{CreateConnector,UpdateConnector,DeleteConnector,DescribeConnector,TagResource,UntagResource}` scoped to `arn:aws:transfer:<region>:<account>:connector/*`, `scheduler:{CreateSchedule,UpdateSchedule,DeleteSchedule,GetSchedule}` scoped to the `connect-sftp-schedules` group, plus `lambda:InvokeFunction` on the `SftpPoller` ARN (for `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp/test-connection`).
- The compilation pipeline workers add `states:{CreateStateMachine,UpdateStateMachine}` and `iam:PassRole` for `RuntimeStateMachineRole` only.
- The `**RuntimeStateMachineRole`** (assumed by every compiled flow / lookup state machine) holds: `lambda:InvokeFunction` on the residual worker ARNs (multipart, blob, file, static-IP HTTP, `SftpPoller`, `WidgetService`, `CreateProxyLinkWorker`, `CleanupApigwWorker`, `ReplyBackWorker`, `SendHealthMetricWorker`, the auth-helper workers, etc.); `dynamodb:PutItem` on `FlowsTable` for webhook task-token registration through `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:dynamodb:putItem.waitForTaskToken`; `**states:InvokeHTTPEndpoint**` scoped to its own state-machine ARN with a `states:HTTPEndpoint` condition listing the partner host allow-list and a `states:HTTPMethod` condition listing the verbs the flow uses (compiler-stamped per flow); `**events:RetrieveConnectionCredentials**` scoped to the EventBridge Connection ARNs the flow references; and `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the secret ARNs created by those Connections (EventBridge stores connection credentials in Secrets Manager). No wildcard HTTP egress permission is ever granted — the host allow-list is recomputed at compile time from the spec's `URL` fields.
- The streaming HTTP worker roles (`HttpJsonStreamingWorker`, `HttpXmlStreamingWorker`, `HttpAnyStreamingWorker`, `FormUrlEncodedStreamingWorker`, plus the static-IP variants when `ResponseMode="S3"`) hold only `s3:PutObject|GetObject` on `VendorsResponsesBucket/<job_id>/` response prefixes, `kms:Encrypt|GenerateDataKey` on `DataKey` when KMS-backed object metadata is used, and read access to the EventBridge Connection-managed secret needed to sign the outbound request. They stream partner bodies with backpressure and never buffer an unbounded response in memory.
- The `EnableStaticIp` / `DisableStaticIp` workers add the strictly-needed `ec2:`* verbs (`DescribeInternetGateways`, `CreateInternetGateway`, `AttachInternetGateway`, `CreateNatGateway`, `AllocateAddress`, etc.) scoped by tag conditions where possible.
- The `**SftpPoller`** role has the strictly-needed AWS Transfer Family verbs (per `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Phase 3 step 4): `transfer:StartDirectoryListing`, `transfer:DescribeDirectoryListing`, `transfer:StartFileTransfer`, `transfer:DescribeConnector` (resource-scoped to `arn:aws:transfer:<region>:<account>:connector/`*), plus `s3:{GetObject,PutObject,ListBucket}` on `VendorsResponsesBucket/transfer-listings/*` and `…/sftp-inbound/*`. It does **not** read partner secrets directly — the **Transfer Family connector role** holds `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the per-partner secret ARNs and `s3:{PutObject,GetObject,ListBucket}` on the same prefixes.
- Workers that emit task callbacks have `states:SendTaskSuccess` / `states:SendTaskFailure` on `*` (Step Functions does not support resource-level constraints here).
- API Gateway routes use API-key + per-route IAM where applicable; partner webhooks use the per-flow `webhook_auth.Secret` (no platform credential).

#### 2.3.7 SFTP via AWS Transfer Family Connectors

SFTP support follows the **listing-first connector + poller** pattern from `build-inbound-sftp-workflows`. There is **no SSH client running inside any Lambda**; every SFTP interaction goes through AWS Transfer Family.

The Marketplace Connect bundle is tenant-agnostic and pre-synthesized, so ConnectStack does **not** create partner-specific `AWS::Transfer::Connector` resources at deploy time. It deploys only the generic SFTP runtime capability: the shared `SftpPoller` Lambda, IAM roles/policies, S3 prefixes, route handlers, and the `connect-sftp-schedules` EventBridge Scheduler group. Tenant-specific connector resources are created, imported, updated, or deleted at runtime through Connect's SFTP configuration API.

Per SFTP partner, the runtime configuration route owns:

1. **One AWS Transfer Family connector** of type `SFTP`, either imported by connector id or created by Connect through `transfer:CreateConnector`. The connector carries:
  - `Url: sftp://<partner-host>[:port]` from the runtime request.
  - `AccessRole`: a per-partner IAM role assumed by Transfer Family with `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the partner's secret ARN and `s3:{PutObject,GetObject,ListBucket}` on `VendorsResponsesBucket/transfer-listings/*` + `…/sftp-inbound/*`.
  - `LoggingRole`: a CloudWatch-Logs-write role for connector access logs.
  - `SftpConfig.UserSecretId`: the partner's Secrets Manager ARN.
  - `SftpConfig.TrustedHostKeys`: SHA-256 fingerprints of the partner's expected host keys (rotated via the runtime update route; never elided to skip verification).
2. **One Connect-owned AWS Secrets Manager secret container per partner**, keyed by the canonical contract `{ "Url": "sftp://...", "Username": "...", "Password": "..." }` (per `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Phase 2). Private-key partners use `{ "Url": ..., "Username": ..., "PrivateKey": "..." }` (RSA / Ed25519) instead of `Password`. Runtime APIs either import a caller-supplied `secret_arn` or create a Connect-namespaced secret such as `/connect/vendors/<vendor_name>/sftp` with only non-secret bootstrap metadata. The operator fills or rotates the secret value through Connect's `PUT/PATCH /vendors/{vendor_name}/credentials` route before any live transfer is considered ready. Secrets are encrypted with `DataKey`.
3. **An optional EventBridge Scheduler schedule** per partner that opted into recurring polling. The schedule's input event matches §6.7 verbatim and includes a deterministic `runId = <partner>-<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>-<HH>` so concurrent polls deduplicate at the listing level.
4. **Connector metadata on the partner row**, including `sftp_connector_id`, `sftp_secret_arn`, default directories/prefixes, schedule expression/state, validation timestamps, and transfer concurrency.

The mapping between `vendor_name` (Connect's identifier) and the Transfer Family `connectorId` lives on the partner row (`sftp_connector_id`); the per-vendor secret ARN and target prefix are also stored there. Partner-specific values (host, secret ARN or create-secret flag, remote directory, target bucket prefix, target schedule, transfer concurrency) are **never hardcoded** in worker source, never carried in CDK context, and never owned by Account — they flow through the runtime config contract in §6.7.

SFTP schedules are created disabled by default unless the partner config explicitly sets `schedule_enabled_after_validation=true` and the partner row has `sftp_last_validated_at`. The required readiness path is: deploy/import the secret container, populate credentials through Connect's credential vault route, run `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp/test-connection`, verify a listing artifact and at least one configured transfer when applicable, then enable the schedule. Account never seeds or retrieves SFTP credentials.

If a partner uses SFTP **only as a flow-driven outbound integration** (push files we generate to them), the same connector definition applies; the flow's `SFTP` step targets the same `SftpPoller` with `direction: "outbound"` (see §3.5.1).

### 2.4 Configuration surface (env vars)

The runtime is configured exclusively via env vars (read once on cold start; missing required values must fail closed via `process.exit(1)` at module load). Notable keys:


| Key                                                                                 | Default                              | Used by                                                                                            |

### 2.5 Library / dependency policy

The implementation is **TypeScript-only** and consumes only the libraries listed below (per `stack-typescript-for-apis`):

- `aws-cdk-lib`, `constructs`, `aws-cdk` for IaC; scaffold with the current Golden Path CDK v2 release.
- `@aws-sdk/client-{dynamodb,s3,sfn,apigateway,ec2,kms,lambda,ssm,sts,transfer,secrets-manager,scheduler,eventbridge}` and `@aws-sdk/credential-providers` for AWS calls. `@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge` is the **only** path for creating, updating, or deleting the `AWS::Events::Connection` resources that back native Step Functions HTTP Tasks; the runtime never calls EventBridge — Step Functions resolves the connection's credentials automatically when executing `arn:aws:states:::http:invoke`.
- `@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb` for typed DynamoDB document mappings.
- `@aws-lambda-powertools/{logger,tracer,metrics,parameters}` for observability and SSM parameter caching.
- `aws4` for SigV4-signed integration helpers and any future cross-service HTTPS calls. The partner credential vault is local to Connect and does **not** call Account or a legacy Account Manager service.
- `zod` for **all** request/response/spec schemas (no `marshmallow`, `jsonschema`, `joi`, `ajv`).
- `undici` for outbound HTTP (or native `fetch` in Node 24); never `axios` or `node-fetch`.
- `fast-xml-parser` for XML transport (XML → JSON parse, JSON → XML serialise).
- `csv-parse` / `csv-stringify` if the batch path needs CSV input/output.
- `vitest` + `@vitest/coverage-v8` for tests.
- `aws-states-language-validator` (or the AWS-published `@aws-sdk/client-stepfunctions::validateStateMachineDefinition` API) for the `ValidateAslDefinition` Lambda.
- **No SSH client.** `ssh2`, `ssh2-sftp-client`, `node-ssh`, and any other in-process SSH/SFTP library are **forbidden** — every SFTP interaction goes through `@aws-sdk/client-transfer` against an AWS Transfer Family connector (per `build-inbound-sftp-workflows`).
- **No in-process code sandbox.** `vm2`, `isolated-vm`, dynamic `eval`, and Node's `node:vm` are **forbidden** in production code paths.
- **LLM use** (e.g. AI-assisted spec authoring or natural-language-to-flow translation, if added) **MUST** route through the **[Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) (`ai` package) with strict TypeScript and Zod tool schemas** — direct `openai`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, or `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` usage is forbidden (per `stack-ai-sdk-for-llm`).
- **Python is forbidden** anywhere in this repository. (PySpark/Glue is the only carve-out in the org, and Connect ships no PySpark/Glue jobs.)

## 3. Data Model & Contracts

### 3.1 Response envelope

All HTTP responses share a uniform shape. Success bodies are route-specific (see §4); errors follow:

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": { "type": "FlowSpecValidationError", "message": "…", "details": { "issues": [ { "path": "/definition/States/Foo", "message": "…" } ] } } }
```

Async submissions return `202 Accepted` and one of `creation_id`, `job_id`, or `batch_execution_id`. Synchronous lookups return `200 OK` with `response_payload`. `204 No Content` is used for deletes.

Every non-mock response always carries `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` and `x-sc-trace-id` (per-request UUID propagated downstream into logs and partner headers).

API Gateway-level errors are normalised by configured `GatewayResponse` rules:

- `INVALID_API_KEY` → `{ "url": "https://api.staircase.co/get-started#root", "message": "This key is not valid for this service." }`
- `BAD_REQUEST_BODY` → `{ "message": $context.error.messageString, "error": $context.error.validationErrorString }`
- `BAD_REQUEST_PARAMETERS` → `{ "message": $context.error.messageString }`
- `DEFAULT_4XX` → `{ "message": "Request has been declined." }`

### 3.2 Partner (`vendor`) entity

Stored on `FlowsTable`. Required fields:


| Field                | Type                    | Notes                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vendor_name`        | string (1..100)         | URL-safe partner identifier; required, unique with `product_name`.                                                                      |
| `product_name`       | string (optional)       | Sub-namespace under a partner.                                                                                                          |
| `company_id`         | string (1..100)         | Optional tenant grouping.                                                                                                               |
| `credentials`        | `Record<string,string>` | Static credentials surfaced as `$vendor_credentials.<key>` **only inside the `Authorization` step**. Encrypted at rest under `DataKey`. |
| `passed_credentials` | `Record<string,string>` | Credentials surfaced as `$.passed_credentials.<key>` inside any flow `Task`. Encrypted at rest.                                         |


`POST /vendors` returns `201 Created` and echoes the request body. `409 Conflict` is returned on `ConditionalCheckFailedException`. `PATCH /vendors/{vendor_name}` permits only `company_id` updates.

### 3.3 Partner connectivity configuration (PCC)

Tenant-scoped overrides of partner credentials. Created via `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/configurations` with body `{ partner_configuration_id, partner_configuration: { partner_configuration: {...overrides...} } }`. Listed via `GET /…/configurations` with cursor pagination (`page.next_token`). Deleted via `DELETE /…/configurations/{partner_configuration_id}` (204 / 404).

PCCs are referenced at execution time via `partner_configuration.partner_configuration_id` in the job body; if the ID is unknown for the partner, the execution returns `404`.

### 3.4 Authorization model (flow spec)

The flow spec declares **how** to authorise outbound partner calls. Three credential-source modes and three auth modes are supported:

#### 3.5.1 Allowed task types (compiler dispatch)

The compiler (`lambda/services/flow-compiler/transformation.ts`) supports the following `ResourceDefinition.Type` values. Per §2.0 principle 2, **HTTP-shaped task types compile to a native Step Functions HTTP Task** (`arn:aws:states:::http:invoke`) bound to an EventBridge `Connection` only when the response contract is inline-small. Non-HTTP task types and the residual HTTP cases that the native integration cannot express end-to-end (multipart, blob streaming, raw binary file download, static-IP-bound egress, or direct response-to-S3 streaming) map to a worker Lambda whose ARN is read from env vars:

The compiler additionally rewrites every leaf "happy" state to flow into a synthesised `ReplyBack` task (and every wildcard catch into a synthesised `ReplyBackError`), so the compiled state machine always finishes with a callback to `job_callback_url`. When `LINK_TRANSFORMATION` is used the cleanup step is wired in automatically.

When the compiler emits a native HTTP Task it also: (a) resolves the partner's EventBridge `Connection` ARN from `connection_arn_for(vendor_name, auth_profile)`; (b) renders the `URL` template (`{path_param}` placeholders + `QueryParameters`) into a static `ApiEndpoint.$` JSONata expression so Step Functions performs the substitution at runtime; (c) translates the spec's `Retry` / `Catch` rules into native ASL retries (for example `States.Http.StatusCode.5XX`, `States.Http.SocketTimeoutError`); and (d) injects a `Timeout` of `RUNTIME_HTTP_TASK_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` unless the spec overrides. It does **not** append S3 staging after the HTTP Task; any task that needs an S3 response reference is compiled to a streaming worker before execution.

#### 3.5.2 Flow specification — typed contract

The full Zod-derived TypeScript contract for the create-flow body. The same shape (with `lookup_name` instead of `flow_name`) is used by the lookup constructor.

```ts
type FlowCreateRequest = {
  flow_name: string;                          // URL-safe; unique per (vendor, product?)

```

The compiler reads this object, performs the rewrites listed in §5.1, and registers a Step Functions state machine whose states have the canonical AWS shape (`Task` → `arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke` against the worker ARN, `WAIT_FOR_TASK_TOKEN` for webhook steps, etc.).

### 3.6 Lookup specification

A *lookup* is structurally a flow but compiled as `STATE_MACHINE_TYPE=EXPRESS` and intended for synchronous request/response. Same compilation pipeline (`LookupCreationStateMachine`), same task types, but the runtime handler invokes the SFN with `start_sync_execution` and returns the response inline (`200 OK` with `{ transaction_id, response_payload }` on success, `400`/`502`/`422` mapped from the SFN's typed errors).

### 3.7 Webhook reference

When a flow contains a webhook step the compiler stores per-step metadata on the flow row (`webhooks_info[]`):

```json
{
  "request_id_expected_path": "$.webhook.request_id",
  "non_blocking": false,
  "processing_order": "FIFO",
  "save_webhook_to_file": false,
  "webhook_response_mapping": { "ConditionsMismatch": { "StatusCode": 200 } },
  "webhook_conditions": [ { "ValuePath": "$.status", "ExpectedValues": ["ok"] } ],
  "webhook_conditions_match_all": false,
  "webhook_auth": { "HeaderName": "X-Partner-Sig", "Secret": "…" }
}
```

The runtime `processWebhook` route iterates `webhooks_info[]` until one matches, validates the auth secret, evaluates conditions (`AND`/`OR` via `webhook_conditions_match_all`), looks up the pending DDB row, and either resolves the task token (via `SendTaskSuccess`) or returns the configured custom error status (mapped through the `WebhookErrorCode` enum in §6.1).

XML-content webhooks are converted to JSON via `fast-xml-parser` before condition matching. If `save_webhook_to_file` is set, the original payload (JSON or XML) is staged in S3 and the task token receives a presigned URL instead of inlined data.

### 3.8 Error catalogue → HTTP status

The HTTP layer is the authoritative tag-to-status mapper. Each error is a structured object with a discriminator (`type` / `_tag`), a `message`, and an optional `details` object. Tags map to:


| HTTP    | Tag(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Error mappings for the webhook surface are additionally configurable per flow via `webhook_response_mapping` (see §3.7); the resolution table lives in `lambda/services/webhooks/error-codes.ts`.

## 4. Synchronous APIs

All public routes are mounted under the API Gateway base path `/connector-jobs/`. The single `ConnectHandler` Lambda hosts a thin `lambda/http/router.ts` that dispatches by `httpMethod` + `resource` to the per-route service. Each route is wrapped in a shared decorator that (a) binds a per-request structured logger keyed by `x-sc-trace-id`, (b) parses the body (or rejects via a Zod-driven `BadRequest`), (c) emits a CloudWatch Logs JSON record on entry/exit, and (d) maps unhandled exceptions to `500 InternalServerError`.

### 4.1 Partners (`/vendors`)

- `POST /vendors` — body validated by `vendorCreateSchema`; persists `vendor_name + product_name` (unique). 201/409/400.
- `GET /vendors` — paginated, sortable (`sort=asc|desc`, `after_name=<name>`), returns `{ count, _links: { next, previous }, vendors[] }`.
- `GET /vendors/{vendor_name}?product_name=…` — single partner.
- `PATCH /vendors/{vendor_name}` — currently `company_id` only.
- `DELETE /vendors/{vendor_name}` — cascades through `FlowsRepository.deleteVendor` (404 if missing).

### 4.2 Partner credential vault (`/vendors/{vendor_name}/credentials`, `…/passed-credentials`)

- Connect is the owner of the partner credential vault. Credentials are stored encrypted under `DataKey` on the partner row (or a colocated `CREDENTIALS#<bucket>` row if the encrypted value would make the partner row too large). Account does not expose `retrieve-credentials`, and Connect never calls `customer-account-manager/retrieve-credentials`.
- `GET` returns the decrypted credential map for the selected bucket to API-key-authorized callers only. This is the only route that returns secret values; all logs and metrics redact the response body. `GET /vendors/{vendor_name}/information` remains the safe presence-only route for dashboards and health checks.
- `PUT` replaces the whole map; `PATCH` merges per key. Body = `{ items: { key: value, … } }`. The handler resolves `credentials` vs `passed_credentials` from the resource path's last segment.
- `DELETE` deletes the selected credential bucket, removes any associated EventBridge Connection ARNs from the partner row, and idempotently deletes the matching `connect-<vendor_name>[-<product_name>][-<auth_profile>]` EventBridge Connections. 204 on success, 404 if the vendor is unknown.
- `**PUT` / `PATCH` on `credentials` also synchronises the partner's EventBridge `Connection` resources** so native Step Functions HTTP Tasks (§5.8) can authenticate without code. The handler interprets well-known credential shapes — `{ basic: { username, password } }` → `BASIC` connection, `{ api_key: { header_name, value } }` → `API_KEY` connection, `{ oauth: { authorization_endpoint, client_id, client_secret, http_method?, oauth_http_parameters? } }` → `OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS` connection — and idempotently creates / updates `connect-<vendor_name>[-<product_name>][-<auth_profile>]`. The connection ARN map is persisted on the partner row (`eventbridge_connection_arns`); deleting a credential bucket deletes the matching connection.
- `GET /vendors/{vendor_name}/information` — returns `{ vendor_name, product_name?, credentials: { credentials: bool, "passed-credentials": bool }, eventbridge_connections: Record<auth_profile, { connection_arn, authorization_type, status }> }` (presence-only; never the values).

### 4.2.1 SFTP connector configuration (`/vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp`)

- `PUT /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp` — create or replace the tenant-specific SFTP connector config. Body `{ mode: "create"|"import", connector_id?, url?, secret_arn?, trusted_host_keys: string[], default_remote_directory?, default_target_prefix?, transfer_concurrency?, schedule_expression?, schedule_enabled_after_validation?: boolean }`. `mode="create"` requires `url`, `secret_arn`, and host keys and calls `transfer:CreateConnector`; `mode="import"` requires `connector_id` and stores the imported connector id after `DescribeConnector` validates it. Writes SFTP fields onto the partner row.
- `PATCH /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp` — update non-secret connector metadata, trusted host keys, default directories, concurrency, or schedule settings. Connector updates call `transfer:UpdateConnector`; schedule updates call `scheduler:CreateSchedule|UpdateSchedule|DeleteSchedule` in `connect-sftp-schedules`.
- `GET /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp` — presence/configuration view: returns connector id, URL host, default directories/prefixes, schedule state, validation timestamps, and whether a secret is configured, but never secret values.
- `DELETE /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp` — disables/deletes the schedule, deletes Connect-created connectors when owned by Connect, preserves imported connectors unless `delete_imported_connector=true`, and clears SFTP fields from the partner row.

These routes are the only place tenant-specific Transfer Family connector resources are created or imported. The pre-synthesized Marketplace bundle never encodes partner hostnames, connector ids, secret ARNs, schedules, directories, or concurrency settings.

### 4.3 Partner connectivity configurations (`/vendors/{vendor_name}/configurations[/{partner_configuration_id}]`)

- `POST` — create. 201 with `{ partner_configuration_id }` (server-generated if absent). 404 if vendor missing. 409 on duplicate.
- `GET` — list with `next_token`/`limit` pagination. 400 on invalid `next_token` (`InvalidNextToken`).
- `DELETE …/{partner_configuration_id}` — 204/404.

### 4.4 Flow / Lookup constructor (`/vendors/{vendor_name}/{entity}`)

`entity ∈ flows | lookups` (see `ALLOWED_ENTITIES` in §6.2). For brevity the table below uses `*` where the two entities differ only in target SFN type:


| Verb     | Path                                     | Behaviour                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/flow/schema?schema_type=create_flow    | update_flow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `POST`   | `/vendors/{vendor_name}/{entity}`        | Validates the spec, generates `creation_id`, stores the raw definition under `_flow_or_lookup_creations/anyflow/<creation_id>.json`, starts the entity-specific compilation SFN with `name=creation_id`. 202 `{ creation_id, creation_status: "Started" }`. |
| `PUT`    | `/vendors/{vendor_name}/{entity}/{name}` | Same pipeline, `_final_action=UPDATE` if the entity exists else `CREATE`.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `GET`    | `/vendors/{vendor_name}/{entity}`        | List flows/lookups for the partner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `GET`    | `/vendors/{vendor_name}/{entity}/{name}` | Single flow/lookup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `DELETE` | `/vendors/{vendor_name}/{entity}/{name}` | Deletes the runtime SFN (`DeleteStateMachine`) **before** wiping the DDB row. 204.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `GET`    | `/{entity}/creations/{creation_id}`      | Tails the compilation SFN execution. 404 on `ExecutionDoesNotExist`. 200 `{ status, error?, cause? }` on found; 429 on throttling.                                                                                                                          |


### 4.5 Job execution (`POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/jobs`)

For `entity=flows`:

- Validate body via `flowInvokeSchema` (Zod).
- Validate `partner_configuration.partner_configuration_id` against `PartnerConfigurationsRepository` (404 if missing).
- Mint `job_id = randomUUID()`.
- Build the canonical async-flow input via `collectCommonAsyncFlowInput(...)` — captures `transaction_id`, `request_payload`, `request_collection_id`, `response_collection_id`, `dry_run` overrides, `callback_url`, the partner's `state_machine_name`, an internal `__internal.execution_start`, `__internal.x_sc_trace_id`, and `__internal.arn_sfn` (the compiled state machine ARN).
- If `contains_widget`, mint a presigned widget HTML upload (default expiration `WIDGET_DEFAULT_EXPIRATION_HOURS`) and inject `widget_url` + `widget_template_name` + (optional) `__internal.widget_render_ack_url` into the payload.
- `serializeFlowInput(...)` checks the size: any payload ≥ `JOB_INPUT_MAX_BYTES` (256 KiB) is rejected with `413 JobInputTooLarge` before the SFN start (it would otherwise fail with `States.DataLimitExceeded`).
- `sfn.send(new StartExecutionCommand({ stateMachineArn: FLOW_DECORATOR_STATE_MACHINE_ARN, name: job_id, input: ... }))` — the decorator SFN then invokes the per-flow SFN with `arn:…states:startExecution.sync:2` and runs the parallel post-processing branch (health metric + reply-back error backup).
- Optional `debug_config.poll_with` triggers a side execution of `InvocationPollerStateMachine` (`name=<job_id>-side-poller`) for callers that want server-side polling.
- Response: `202` `{ job_id, job_status: "Started", widget_url? }`.
- Emits CloudWatch metrics `jobs_started` (Count, `dimensions={vendor_name, flow_name}`) and `job_input_bytes` (Bytes), buffered through Powertools and flushed in `finally`.

For `entity=lookups`: invokes the EXPRESS state machine via `StartSyncExecutionCommand`, then returns `{ transaction_id, response_payload }` (or 400/502/422 mapped from the SFN error envelope through `representations.parseStateRuntime` and `_error_result`/`_ok_result` decoding).

### 4.6 Batch execution (`POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/batch-executions`)

- Body: `{ batch_input: { data_source: "s3://…" }, batch_configuration: { maximum_concurrency, maximum_items_per_batch }, … }`.
- Mint `batch_execution_id = randomUUID()`.
- `BatchInputPreparer.getStateMachineInput(...)` materialises a JSON-array S3 object that the Distributed Map will iterate over. Output goes under `<PRE_BATCHED_OBJECTS_PREFIX>output/`.
- `sfn.send(new StartExecutionCommand({ stateMachineArn: BATCH_INVOCATION_STATE_MACHINE_ARN, name: batch_execution_id, input: serialized_payload }))` triggers the batch SFN. Each map iteration: `wrapContext → composeCanonicalInput → invokeStepFunction (sync:2) → PostProcessing (SendMetric ‖ DecideIfNeedsBackupReply → ReplyBackErrorBackup)`. Map run results are aggregated by `BatchPostProcessor`.
- Response `202` `{ batch_execution_id, batch_execution_status: "Started" }`.

### 4.7 Batch aggregation (`GET /batch-executions/{batch_execution_id}/aggregation`)

- Calls `DescribeExecutionCommand`, `ListMapRunsCommand({maxResults: 1})`, then `DescribeMapRunCommand`.
- Returns `{ batch_execution_status, batch_execution_id, batch_execution_items_aggregation: { pending, pending_redrive, running, succeeded, failed, timed_out, aborted, total }, batch_execution_executions_aggregation: {...same…} }`. Adds an `error: { error, cause }` block when the SFN status ∈ `{ABORTED, FAILED, TIMED_OUT}`.
- 404 on `ExecutionDoesNotExist` / `ValidationException` / missing map run.
- `POST /batch-executions/{batch_execution_id}/redrive` — calls `RedriveExecutionCommand` on the batch parent execution ARN. For failed Distributed Map runs, Step Functions redrives unsuccessful map children from the parent workflow; Connect must not enumerate child executions or call `StartExecution` itself. Body and error mapping match the job redrive route in §4.8.

### 4.8 Job status & history

- `GET /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/jobs/{job_id}` (`?detailed=…&next_token=…&reverse_order=…&max_results=…`). Tails `DescribeExecutionCommand` + `GetExecutionHistoryCommand`. Detailed mode includes per-state `input_details.request_payload` and `output_details.response_payload` (sanitised through `representations.flowExecutionHistoryErrorCauseNormalizer`). Always returns `executed_events`, `last_event`, `details`, plus an `input` block (`transaction_id`, collection IDs, `callback_url`), an `output` block (`response_payload`, `extraction_errors`), and `redrive: { count, date?, status, status_reason? }` copied from Step Functions `redriveCount`, `redriveDate`, `redriveStatus`, and `redriveStatusReason` when available. When the request comes from an authoriser context with `disableDataDisplay=true`, `detailed` is forced to `false`, `callback_url` is stripped from `input`, and `output` is emptied. 404 falls back to `tryStatusCorrectionFromInvoker(job_id)` so an in-progress decorator execution still returns `IN_PROGRESS`.
- `GET /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/executions` — `ListExecutionsCommand` over the runtime SFN (or the map-run when `batch_execution_id` is supplied). Supports `next_token`, `status_filter`, `max_results` (Zod-validated); `status_filter` includes Step Functions' `PENDING_REDRIVE` status. 400 on invalid `next_token`.
- `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/jobs/{job_id}` — `StopExecutionCommand`. 201 `{ job_id, status: "ABORTED", stop_date }`. 404 on `ExecutionDoesNotExist`.
- `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/jobs/{job_id}/redrive` — redrives an unsuccessful STANDARD Step Functions execution via [`RedriveExecution`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_RedriveExecution.html). Body: `{ client_token?: string }`, where `client_token` maps directly to AWS `clientToken` (`1..64` printable ASCII chars) and should be supplied by callers that may retry the HTTP request; Step Functions keeps idempotent responses for the last 10 successful client tokens for up to 15 minutes. Connect first resolves the job's execution ARN and calls `DescribeExecutionCommand({ includedData: "METADATA_ONLY" })`; if `redriveStatus !== "REDRIVABLE"`, return `409 ExecutionNotRedrivable` with `{ status, redrive_status, redrive_status_reason }`. Otherwise call `RedriveExecutionCommand({ executionArn, clientToken })`. Success returns `202` with `{ job_id, execution_arn, status, redrive_date, redrive_count }`; `status` and `redrive_count` come from a best-effort follow-up `DescribeExecutionCommand` and may lag because Step Functions `DescribeExecution` is eventually consistent. `ExecutionDoesNotExist` maps to 404, `ExecutionLimitExceeded` / Step Functions throttling maps to 429, and transient SFN failures map to `503 StepFunctionsTransientError`.

### 4.9 Webhooks (`POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/webhook`)

- Partner-authenticated via per-flow `webhook_auth.HeaderName`/`Secret`; the API key is **not** required.
- Iterates `flow.webhooks_info[]`:
  1. Verify auth. On mismatch → `Unauthorized` (status code resolved via `webhook_response_mapping["Unauthorized"]`).
  2. Convert to JSON if the content type is `application/xml`/`text/xml` (via `fast-xml-parser`).
  3. Resolve `request_id_expected_path` via JSONPath; on miss → `NoRequestIdFoundInPayload`.
  4. Look up the pending request row (`getRequest(request_id)` for blocking webhooks, `getUnusedNonBlockingRequest(request_id, processing_order)` for non-blocking).
  5. Evaluate `webhook_conditions[]` honouring `webhook_conditions_match_all` (defaults to OR).
- On success: write the payload to S3 if `save_webhook_to_file`, then `SendTaskSuccessCommand({ taskToken, output })`. Mark non-blocking rows inactive via `markNonBlockingRequestInactive(request)`.
- Always emits a `code-health-checker/metrics` POST (silent best-effort) with `transaction_id`, `webhook_request_id`, status, invocation code, elapsed seconds, configuration ID, build hash, and `x-sc-trace-id`.
- The response always carries `X-Sc-Origin-Trace-Id` from the original request when known.

### 4.10 Response recovery (`POST /response-url-recovery`)

- Body: `{ job_id, expiration?: int seconds default 3600, next_token? }`. Lists up to 100 keys under `<job_id>/` from `VendorsResponsesBucket` and returns presigned `GET` URLs (`@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`). Pagination via `ContinuationToken`.

### 4.11 Tokens (`/tokens/{token_name}`)

- `POST` create with `{ token_value, extra? }`. 201/409/400.
- `GET` returns `{ token_name, token_value, extra }`.
- `PATCH` updates `token_value` and optional `extra`. 404 on missing.
- `DELETE` removes; 404 on missing.

### 4.12 Static IP (`/network/ip`)

- `GET` returns `{ ip, resource_status: { elastic_ip: ALLOCATED|DEALLOCATED_OR_NEVER_EXISTED, network_translator: ENABLED|ENABLING_PENDING|DISABLING_PENDING|DISABLED_OR_NEVER_CREATED } }`. Returns `500 UnexpectedResourceState` if more than one EIP or NAT exists with the matching tag set.
- `POST /network/ip` — kicks off `EnableStaticIpStateMachine` (idempotent through tag matchers). 202.
- `DELETE /network/ip` — kicks off `DisableStaticIpStateMachine`. 202.

### 4.13 SFTP test connection (`POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp/test-connection`)

- Body (Zod-validated, all optional except `remote_directory` if the partner config doesn't carry a default): `{ remote_directory?: string, transfer_concurrency?: number, dry_run?: boolean }`. `dry_run: true` means **list only** — no `StartFileTransfer` is issued, only `StartDirectoryListing`.
- The handler resolves `sftp_connector_id`, default `target_bucket`, default `target_prefix`, and default `remote_directory` from the partner row in `FlowsTable`. 404 `SftpConnectorNotConfigured` if the partner has no SFTP connector.
- Synchronously invokes `SftpPoller` with the `runId = "test-<creation_id>"` and `direction: "inbound"`. Returns `200 OK` with `{ listingId, listingS3Uri, fileCount, sampledFiles[], transferIds[], errors[] }`.
- This route is the manual invocation path required by `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Phase 5; no recurring schedule is started by it.

### 4.14 Internal helpers

- `GET /information` — API Gateway MOCK integration that returns the deployer-supplied `ServiceInfo` JSON (200, with CORS headers).
- `proxy-links/{...}` — dynamically created at runtime by `CreateProxyLinkWorker`; each maps a vanity path to a redirect to a partner-supplied or S3-presigned URL. `CleanupApigwWorker` removes them after the flow ends. `ProxyResourceCleanupCustomResource` purges leftover resources on every deploy.

### 4.15 Service composition / dependency wiring

Each route scopes its own dependency container so that a config error in an unrelated route cannot break this one. The composition groups are:

- **Partners router** depends on: `FlowsRepository`, `vendorCreateSchema`, `vendorUpdateSchema`, KMS encryption helpers.
- **Credentials router** depends on: `FlowsRepository`, `CredentialVaultService`, `EventBridgeConnectionRegistry`, and KMS encryption helpers.
- **Configurations router** depends on: `PartnerConfigurationsRepository`.
- **Constructor router** depends on: `FlowsRepository`, `flowCreateSchema`, `flowUpdateSchema`, `lookupCreateSchema`, `lookupUpdateSchema`, `S3CreationStore`, `SfnClient`.
- **Jobs router** depends on: `FlowsRepository`, `PartnerConfigurationsRepository`, `WidgetService`, `SfnClient`, `ExecutionRedriveService`, `MetricsBuffer`.
- **Batch router** depends on: `FlowsRepository`, `BatchInputPreparer`, `S3Client`, `SfnClient`, `ExecutionRedriveService`.
- **Execution redrive service** is shared by jobs and batch routes; it resolves the canonical execution ARN, calls `DescribeExecution`, enforces `redriveStatus === "REDRIVABLE"`, invokes `RedriveExecution`, and emits redrive metrics.
- **Webhooks router** depends on: `FlowsRepository`, `WebhookConditionEvaluator`, `XmlConverter`, `SfnClient` (for `SendTaskSuccess`), `HealthMetricClient`.
- **Tokens router** depends on: `TokensRepository`.
- **Static-IP router** depends on: the EC2 client + the two enable/disable SFN ARNs.
- **SFTP router** depends on: `FlowsRepository` (to create/import/update/delete the partner's `sftp_connector_id` and runtime metadata), `TransferFamilyClient`, `SchedulerClient`, `LambdaClient` (for invoking `SftpPoller`), and the bounded SFTP config/test schemas.

Containers are constructed **once per Lambda warm container**, not per request, so caches (e.g. SSM-backed config) survive across invocations.

## 5. Asynchronous Pipelines

### 5.1 Flow / Lookup compilation pipeline

State machines: `FlowCreationStateMachine` and `LookupCreationStateMachine` (STANDARD type).

```
TransformFlowSpec        (Lambda: TransformFlowSpec / TransformLookupSpec)
   │  reads $._flow_or_lookup_creations/anyflow/<creation_id>.json definition
   │  rewrites every state per §3.5.1
   ↓
CredentialsChoice (Choice)

   ├── dynamic   → AuthorizationChoice

DryRunChoice (Choice)
   ├── dry_run absent  → ValidateAslDefinition (Lookup pipeline goes straight to CreateOrUpdateChoice)
   └── dry_run present → AddDryRun                  → ValidateAslDefinition
ValidateAslDefinition    (Lambda: TS, calls @aws-sdk/client-stepfunctions::validateStateMachineDefinition)
   ↓
CreateOrUpdateChoice (Choice)
   ├── _final_action == CREATE  → CreateRuntimeStateMachine
   └── _final_action == UPDATE  → UpdateRuntimeStateMachine
SaveFlow                 (Lambda: persists the flow row + `state_machine_name` + `webhooks_info[]`)
```

Common rules:

- All Lambda tasks have `Retry on Lambda.TooManyRequestsException` (`IntervalSeconds=2, MaxAttempts=8, BackoffRate=2`) and `Catch: States.ALL → FailState (ResultPath: $.error)`.
- `FailState` is a terminal `Type: Fail`; the API surface (`GET /{entity}/creations/{creation_id}`) extracts the `error`/`cause` from the matching `*FailedEventDetails` event (see `FAILED_EVENT_TYPES` in `lambda/services/sfn/failed-event-types.ts`).
- The compiler **rewrites `Fail` states** in user input to invoke `ProcessFailStatesWorker`, then routes to `ReplyBackError`, so any partner-side error path always closes the loop with a callback POST.
- The compiler reads the compiled definition from S3 (large definitions stored under `_flow_or_lookup_creations/anyflow/<creation_id>.json`) to dodge the 256-KB Step-Functions input limit.
- `CreateRuntimeStateMachine` calls `CreateStateMachineCommand` with the constrained `RuntimeStateMachineRole` (`role.assumedBy=states.amazonaws.com`, policies = `lambda:InvokeFunction` on each worker ARN + `dynamodb:PutItem` on `FlowsTable` for `PutItem.waitForTaskToken` webhook rows).

### 5.2 Runtime flow execution (decorator `FlowDecoratorStateMachine`)

```
invokeStepFunction       (states:startExecution.sync:2 → $.['__internal.arn_sfn'])
   ├── Retry 10× on StepFunctions.ExecutionLimitExceeded
   └── Catch States.ALL → PostProcessing (with $.error)
PostProcessing           (Parallel)
   ├── SendMetric        (Lambda: SendHealthMetricWorker — pushes flow-completion metric to code-health-checker)
   └── ReplyBackErrorBackup (Lambda: ReplyBackWorker)
FinalizeOriginalStatus
   ├── $.error present → ExecutionFailedTerminator (Type: Fail)
   └── otherwise       → Done
```

`ReplyBackWorker` is the cross-cutting integration callback. It can run as the natural last step of a successful flow (called from inside the runtime SFN as `ReplyBack`) or as a backup after a `States.Runtime` / `States.DataLimitExceeded` error (called from this branch). It POSTs to the caller-supplied `callback_url` with:

```json
{
  "webhook_type": "flow_completion",
  "job_id": "...",
  "job_status": "Completed|Failed",
  "transaction_id": "...",
  "request_collection_id": "...",
  "response_collection_id": "...",
  "response_payload": { "...": "..." },
  "status_code": 200
}
```

Headers always include `x-api-key` (the original caller's) and `X-Sc-Trace-Id`. Any non-2xx callback raises `CallProductError` and is retried up to 9 times (with `_WatcherThrottled` back-pressure honoured for `ThrottlingException`).

#### 5.2.1 Execution redrive semantics

Connect redrive is a thin wrapper over AWS Step Functions [`RedriveExecution`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_RedriveExecution.html), not a new `StartExecution` run. The redriven execution keeps the same execution ARN, same input, same state-machine definition, and appends redrive events to the existing execution history. Successful states are not rerun; Step Functions resumes from the failed, aborted, or timed-out state. For `Parallel` and inline `Map` states, only unsuccessful branches / iterations are redriven. For the batch `Distributed Map`, Connect redrives the parent execution; Step Functions handles unsuccessful child workflows and map-run state.

Eligibility is AWS-owned and is checked with `DescribeExecution.redriveStatus` before the mutating call. Connect treats `REDRIVABLE` as the only allowed value and rejects `NOT_REDRIVABLE` / `REDRIVABLE_BY_MAP_RUN` with `409 ExecutionNotRedrivable`. The main AWS constraints to surface in `details` are: Standard workflows only (lookups are EXPRESS and cannot be redriven), execution status is not `SUCCEEDED` or `RUNNING`, execution was started on or after 2023-11-15, redrive is within 14 days after execution close, maximum open time has not exceeded one year, and execution history has fewer than 24,999 events. Retry counters on redriven `Task`, `Parallel`, and inline `Map` states reset to zero for the redrive attempt.

Because native redrive requires an unsuccessful Step Functions execution, Connect failure handling must preserve terminal failure for redrive-eligible jobs. `ReplyBackError` still runs before completion so the caller receives `job_status=Failed`, but partner/runtime failures must then terminate the canonical job execution as `FAILED`, `TIMED_OUT`, or `ABORTED` rather than swallowing the error into a successful wrapper execution. If a flow's failure path intentionally converts an error into business success, the job is not redrivable and the redrive route returns the AWS `redriveStatusReason`.

### 5.3 Server-side polling (`InvocationPollerStateMachine`)

```
PollTask (Lambda: PollInvocationWorker)
RetryPollOrStop (Choice on $.keep_polling)
   ├── true → Waiter (SecondsPath: $.polling_interval) → PollTask
   └── false → Done (Pass → end)
```

The polling interval defaults to 30 s. `PollInvocationWorker` describes the underlying execution and toggles `keep_polling=false` on terminal status.

### 5.4 Batch execution (`BatchInvocationStateMachine`)

```
distributeBatch          (Distributed Map)
   ItemReader: s3:getObject ($.control.data_bucket / $.control.data_key, JSON)
   ItemBatcher: $.control.batch_max_len items × $.control.batch_max_bytes bytes per batch
   MaxConcurrencyPath: $.control.max_concurrency
   ToleratedFailurePercentage: 100 (failures bubble through map_run_error)
   ResultWriter: s3:putObject ($.control.data_bucket / $.control.data_output_key_prefix)
   ItemProcessor (DISTRIBUTED, STANDARD):
      wrapContext → composeCanonicalInput → invokeStepFunction (sync:2) → PostProcessing
postProcessMapRun        (Lambda: BatchPostProcessor, OutputPath: $.map_run_ok)
   on failure → postProcessMapRunError (Type: Fail, error: Connect.PostProcessingFailure)
```

Per-item retries match the decorator (`StepFunctions.ExecutionLimitExceeded` 10×, then `States.ALL` catch routes the failure into `ReplyBackErrorBackup`). The map run rolls per-item outputs to S3; `BatchPostProcessor` validates the aggregate state (`pending`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `timedOut`, `aborted`) and exposes them via `GET /batch-executions/{batch_execution_id}/aggregation`.

### 5.5 Webhook ingress (`WAIT_FOR_TASK_TOKEN`)

The compiled flow embeds a `Task` whose `Resource` is `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:dynamodb:putItem.waitForTaskToken`. This intentionally uses the Step Functions AWS SDK integration, not the optimized `arn:aws:states:::dynamodb:putItem` integration, because optimized DynamoDB tasks do not support the callback token pattern. Parameters:

```
TableName: <FlowsTable name>
Item:
  pk.S.$               : States.Format('REQUEST#{}', <ValuePath from spec>)
  sk.S.$               : States.UUID()
  task_token.S.$       : $$.Task.Token
  transaction_id.S.$   : $.transaction_id
  response_collection_id.S.$ : $.response_collection_id
  job_id.S.$           : $.job_id
  x_sc_trace_id.S.$    : $.x_sc_trace_id
  non_blocking.BOOL    : true|false
  processing_order.S   : FIFO|LIFO              # non-blocking only
  ttlEpochSeconds.N    : <optional expiry epoch seconds as a string>
```

Because the DynamoDB write is the callback-waiting task itself, the `REQUEST#<request_id>` row is durable before Step Functions pauses for the partner callback. `processWebhook` can therefore resolve a very fast callback without racing an asynchronous writer. Non-blocking webhooks still store `processing_order` so identical `request_id`s arriving concurrently can be matched in FIFO/LIFO order.

### 5.6 SFTP listing-and-transfer (`SftpPoller`)

`SftpPoller` implements the listing-first runtime described in `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Phase 4. It is invoked synchronously by:

1. The compiled flow's `SFTP` step (`Resource: arn:aws:states:::lambda:invoke` against `SftpPoller` ARN, with `Payload` matching §6.7).
2. An EventBridge Scheduler `Schedule` (per partner that opted into recurring polling).
3. The `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp/test-connection` route (manual, dry-run-friendly).

Runtime sequence (single invocation, no SSH client in process):

```
SftpPoller(input)
  1. resolve config: event > env defaults > deny if missing required values
     ({ vendor_name, connector_id, remote_directory, target_bucket, target_prefix?,
        transfer_concurrency=SFTP_DEFAULT_TRANSFER_CONCURRENCY,
        direction="inbound"|"outbound",
        runId })
  2. compute deterministic listing key:
       <SFTP_LISTINGS_PREFIX><vendor_name>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<runId>/listing.json
  3. transfer.send(StartDirectoryListingCommand({
       ConnectorId,
       RemoteDirectoryPath: remote_directory,
       OutputDirectoryPath: `s3://${SFTP_LISTINGS_BUCKET}/<derived listing prefix>`,
     }))
  4. poll DescribeDirectoryListing every SFTP_LISTING_POLL_INTERVAL_MS
     until status ∈ {COMPLETED, FAILED} or elapsed > SFTP_LISTING_MAX_WAIT_MS
       → on timeout: return SftpListingTimeout (HTTP 422 if surfaced via API)
       → on FAILED: return SftpTransferError with bounded cause + listingId
  5. s3.send(GetObjectCommand({ Bucket, Key: listingKey })) → parse JSON listing
     defensively (tolerate missing fields, treat empty as "0 files")
  6. dedupe file paths (by full remote path), sort lexicographically
  7. for each surviving path, in batches of `transfer_concurrency`:
       transfer.send(StartFileTransferCommand({
         ConnectorId,
         RetrieveFilePaths: [remotePath],     // direction=inbound
         // or SendFilePaths: [...] for direction=outbound
         LocalDirectoryPath: `/${SFTP_INBOUND_PREFIX}<vendor>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/`,
       }))
       retry on ThrottlingException / 5xx up to SFTP_TRANSFER_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS
       with full-jitter exponential backoff
  8. return {
       listingId, listingS3Uri, fileCount, sampledFiles[],
       transferIds[], errors: TruncatedErrorList
     }
```

Outputs are deterministic and machine-readable: every listing artifact lands at the dated path above, every transferred file lands at `s3://<target_bucket>/<SFTP_INBOUND_PREFIX><vendor>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<remote-path>` (basename preserved), and the response shape is constant across success/partial-failure (errors are bounded to the first 25 entries to keep the payload under the 256 KB SFN-output limit). Per-partner concurrency caps and remote-directory paths are **never hardcoded** in this Lambda — they always flow through the event or the per-partner env defaults from §2.4.

### 5.7 Static-IP provisioning (`EnableStaticIpStateMachine` / `DisableStaticIpStateMachine`)

`EnableStaticIp` runs:

```
CreateInternetGateway → CreatePublicSubnet → AllocateAddress → CreateNatGateway (with extra retry on WaitSignalIfNatIsNotYetCreated, up to ~85 min) → CreateTwoPrivateRoutes
```

with a single `Catch → ProcessAndReportFailure → ExecutionFailedTerminator (Type: Fail)` for any state. `DisableStaticIp` mirrors the operations in reverse. Both are idempotent (each step inspects the existing tagged resource set first via the `aws-sdk` EC2 client). The two static-IP Lambdas (`HttpJsonStaticIpWorker`, `HttpXmlStaticIpWorker`) live in the `app` subnets so their egress always goes through the configured NAT.

### 5.8 Native Step Functions HTTP Tasks (inline transport)

Per §2.0 principle 2 and §3.5.1, a plain HTTP task type compiles to an `arn:aws:states:::http:invoke` Task only when the task declares `ResponseMode: "INLINE"` and `MaxResponseBytes <= RUNTIME_HTTP_TASK_MAX_INLINE_RESPONSE_BYTES`. Step Functions itself opens the TLS connection, applies authorisation from the bound EventBridge `Connection`, sends the request, and parses the response. There is no Lambda hop on this hot path, but the compiler uses it only when the response cannot exceed the Step Functions payload quota.

Compiled shape (canonical):

```json
{
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:states:::http:invoke",
  "Arguments": {
    "ApiEndpoint.$": "<resolved URL with PathParameters substituted>",
    "Method": "<GET|POST|PUT|DELETE>",
    "Authentication": {
      "ConnectionArn": "<arn of arn:aws:events:<region>:<account>:connection/connect-<vendor>[-<auth_profile>]>"
    },
    "Headers": {
      "Content-Type": "<application/json | application/xml | application/x-www-form-urlencoded | …>",
      "X-Sc-Trace-Id.$": "$.x_sc_trace_id"
    },
    "QueryParameters.$": "<spec-resolved object or omitted>",
    "RequestBody.$": "<spec-resolved JSON|string|States.Base64Encode(...) expression>",
    "Transform": { "RequestBodyEncoding": "NONE" }
  },
  "Retry": [
    { "ErrorEquals": ["States.Http.StatusCode.429"],            "IntervalSeconds": 2,  "MaxAttempts": 5, "BackoffRate": 2 },
    { "ErrorEquals": ["States.Http.StatusCode.5XX",
                       "States.Http.SocketTimeoutError",
                       "States.Http.ConnectionError"],          "IntervalSeconds": 2,  "MaxAttempts": 4, "BackoffRate": 2 }
  ],
  "Catch": [
    { "ErrorEquals": ["States.Http.StatusCode.4XX"], "Next": "ReplyBackError", "ResultPath": "$.error" },
    { "ErrorEquals": ["States.ALL"],                  "Next": "ReplyBackError", "ResultPath": "$.error" }
  ],
  "ResultPath": "<spec-resolved (e.g. $.pull)>",
  "TimeoutSeconds": 60
}
```

Behaviour the compiler enforces:

- **EventBridge `Connection` binding is mandatory.** Compile-time: the partner row is read; if no connection ARN exists for the requested `auth_profile`, compilation fails with `400 FlowSpecValidationError: missing EventBridge connection for vendor=<vendor>, auth_profile=<profile>`. The connection material (`API_KEY`, `BASIC`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`) is configured by the credentials routes in §4.2 — the runtime never reads it directly.
- **OAuth2 token rotation is delegated to EventBridge.** When a connection's `AuthorizationType` is `OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`, EventBridge handles the token fetch and refresh; the central token registry (`TokensTable`) is reserved for partners that do not fit the EventBridge OAuth2 model (e.g. proprietary token responses, multi-step exchanges).
- **Retry classification uses native ASL error names.** `States.Http.StatusCode.<code>`, `States.Http.StatusCode.4XX`, `States.Http.StatusCode.5XX`, `States.Http.SocketTimeoutError`, `States.Http.ConnectionError`, `States.Http.RetryableConnectionFailure`. The compiler turns the spec's `IgnoreResponseStatus`, `RaiseErrorWithDotStatus`, and `Retry` rules into the matching ASL retries; nothing is implemented in code.
- **Inline response gate.** The compiler rejects native HTTP compilation unless `ResponseMode: "INLINE"` and `MaxResponseBytes` is a positive integer at or below `RUNTIME_HTTP_TASK_MAX_INLINE_RESPONSE_BYTES`. It also stamps `Accept` / partner-specific headers from the spec, but those headers are not trusted as an enforcement mechanism; if the partner returns an oversized inline body anyway, Step Functions will fail the execution with `States.DataLimitExceeded`, which is treated as a partner contract violation. Flows that cannot tolerate that risk must use `ResponseMode: "S3"`.
- **Tracing.** The compiler always injects `X-Sc-Trace-Id.$ = $.x_sc_trace_id` and `X-Sc-Job-Id.$ = $.job_id` into `Headers` so partner-side logs correlate with our trace ID.
- **Allow-listed hosts only.** The `RuntimeStateMachineRole` policy's `states:HTTPEndpoint` condition stamps the host allow-list at compile time from the spec's `URL` fields. A flow that tries to call a host outside its declared allow-list fails the IAM check at execution time, not at compile time, which catches dynamic-URL exfiltration attempts.
- **Static-IP exception.** When the spec sets `Type: HTTP_JSON_WITH_EIP` / `HTTP_XML_WITH_EIP`, the compiler emits a `lambda:invoke` against `HttpJsonStaticIpWorker` / `HttpXmlStaticIpWorker` instead — native HTTP Tasks cannot be pinned to the on-demand NAT EIP. Those workers use the same `ResponseMode` contract and stream to S3 when requested.

### 5.9 Streaming HTTP workers (S3 response mode)

`ResponseMode: "S3"` is mandatory when `SaveResponseToFile=true`, when the partner response size is unknown, or when `MaxResponseBytes > RUNTIME_HTTP_TASK_MAX_INLINE_RESPONSE_BYTES`. The compiler emits a `lambda:invoke` task for the matching streaming worker instead of an HTTP Task, so the response body never appears as a Step Functions state output.

Runtime sequence:

```
Http*StreamingWorker(input)
  1. resolve URL, method, headers, query, and body from the same compiled spec fields used by native HTTP Tasks
  2. retrieve the EventBridge Connection-managed credentials or static auth profile needed for the outbound request
  3. issue the partner request with `undici`, enforcing timeout, retry, and status handling from the flow spec
  4. stream the response body directly to s3://<VendorsResponsesBucket>/<job_id>/<state_name>/<response_id>.body
  5. write bounded metadata beside it (`.metadata.json`: status_code, headers allow-list, content_type, byte_count, sha256, received_at)
  6. return only {
       ok, status_code, s3_uri, presigned_url, content_type,
       byte_count, sha256, response_metadata_s3_uri
     }
```

The worker enforces `STREAMING_HTTP_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` when configured; exceeding it aborts the stream, deletes the partial object, and returns `PartnerResponseTooLarge` through the normal `Catch` path. Downstream states must consume the returned S3 reference, not an inline body. This is the only valid large-response path; the compiler must never emit a native HTTP Task followed by `s3:putObject` for a partner response body.

This pattern keeps the runtime surface area small: the **only** Lambdas in the request hot path are the residual cases (`POST_MULTIPART`, `PUT_MULTIPART`, `POST_BLOB`, `PUT_BLOB`, `GET_FILE`, the streaming/static-IP HTTP workers, and `SftpPoller`). Everything else — branching, looping, retry, inline HTTP, DynamoDB task-token registration, sub-state-machine invocation — is native ASL.

## 6. Internal Data Schemas

### 6.1 Webhook error codes → invocation codes

```
NoRequestIdFoundInPayload         → 4000
Unauthorized                       → 4001
ConditionsMismatch                 → 4003
RequestIdNotFoundNoPendingFlow     → 4004
RequestIdAlreadyProcessed          → 4009
CannotContinueFlowBase             → 4022
CannotContinueFlowTimeout          → 4022
CannotContinueFlowExpired          → 4022
CannotContinueFlowCorruptState     → 4022
(default)                          → 5000
```

Each code has a default HTTP status and a per-flow override slot inside `webhook_response_mapping`.

```ts
type WebhookErrorCode =
  | "NoRequestIdFoundInPayload"
  | "Unauthorized"
  | "ConditionsMismatch"
  | "RequestIdNotFoundNoPendingFlow"
  | "RequestIdAlreadyProcessed"
  | "CannotContinueFlowBase"
  | "CannotContinueFlowTimeout"
  | "CannotContinueFlowExpired"
  | "CannotContinueFlowCorruptState"
  | "Default";

type WebhookResponseMapping = Partial<Record<WebhookErrorCode, { StatusCode: number }>>;
```

### 6.2 Allowed entities (constructor)

```ts
const ALLOWED_ENTITIES = {
  flows:   { plural: "flows",   singular: "flow",   nameField: "flow_name",   stateMachineType: "STANDARD" },
  lookups: { plural: "lookups", singular: "lookup", nameField: "lookup_name", stateMachineType: "EXPRESS"  },
} as const;
```

The two share the same compilation pipeline; only the destination state-machine type and the synchronous-vs-asynchronous invocation pattern differ.

### 6.3 Async flow input (decorator SFN payload)

```ts
type AsyncFlowInput = {
  job_id: string;                       // uuid
  api_key: string;                      // forwarded from x-api-key
  transaction_id?: string;
  request_host: string;
  request_path: string;
  vendor_name: string;
  product_name?: string;
  flow_name: string;
  state_machine_name: string;           // <product?>-<vendor>-<flow>[-<token>]
  request_collection_id?: string;
  response_collection_id?: string;
  request_payload: unknown;
  origin_request_payload: unknown;
  callback_url: string;
  partner_configuration?: { partner_configuration_id: string };
  dry_run: boolean;
  widget_url?: string;
  widget_template_name?: string;
  "__internal.arn_sfn": string;         // arn:aws:states:::stateMachine:<dynamic>
  "__internal.execution_start": string; // ISO8601 UTC
  "__internal.x_sc_trace_id": string;
  "__internal.widget_render_ack_url"?: string;
  "__internal.is_batch"?: true;         // batch path only
};
```

### 6.4 Webhook reference row (DDB)

```ts
type WebhookReferenceRow = {
  pk: `REQUEST#${string}`;              // request_id
  sk: string;                           // random suffix
  task_token: string;
  transaction_id: string;
  job_id: string;
  response_collection_id?: string;
  x_sc_trace_id?: string;
  non_blocking: boolean;
  processing_order?: "FIFO" | "LIFO";
  inactive?: true;                      // set by markNonBlockingRequestInactive
  ttlEpochSeconds?: number;             // TTL cleanup of long-pending rows
};
```

### 6.5 Flow row (DDB)

```ts
type WebhookInfo = {
  request_id_expected_path: string;
  non_blocking: boolean;
  processing_order?: "FIFO" | "LIFO";
  save_webhook_to_file?: boolean;
  webhook_response_mapping?: WebhookResponseMapping;
  webhook_conditions?: Array<{ ValuePath: string; ExpectedValues: unknown[] }>;
  webhook_conditions_match_all?: boolean;     // default false -> OR semantics
  webhook_auth?: { HeaderName: string; Secret: string };
  save_output_to?: string;                    // defaults to "$.webhook_data"
};

type FlowRow = {
  pk: `VENDOR#${string}` | `VENDOR#${string}#${string}`;
  sk: `FLOW#${string}` | "VENDOR";       // "VENDOR" sk holds the partner-level row
  type: "FLOW" | "VENDOR";
  vendor_name: string;
  product_name?: string;
  flow_name?: string;                    // FLOW rows only
  configuration_id?: string;
  state_machine_name?: string;
  state_machine_type?: "STANDARD" | "EXPRESS";
  contains_widget?: boolean;
  widget_expiration_hours?: number;
  webhooks_info?: WebhookInfo[];
  definition?: FlowSpecDefinition;       // user-authored spec
  delivery_settings?: unknown;
  version?: string;
  // SFTP fields live on the VENDOR row (sk: "VENDOR"):
  sftp_connector_id?: string;            // AWS::Transfer::Connector connectorId
  sftp_connector_ownership?: "CONNECT_MANAGED" | "IMPORTED";
  sftp_secret_arn?: string;              // Secrets Manager ARN holding Url/Username/Password
  sftp_default_remote_directory?: string;
  sftp_default_target_prefix?: string;
  sftp_schedule_expression?: string;     // EventBridge Scheduler expression (optional)
  sftp_schedule_name?: string;
  sftp_schedule_enabled?: boolean;
  sftp_last_validated_at?: string;
  // EventBridge Connection ARNs that back native Step Functions HTTP Tasks (§5.8) live on the VENDOR row:
  eventbridge_connection_arns?: Record<
    string,                              // auth_profile, e.g. "default", "oauth", "basic"
    {
      connection_arn: string;            // arn:aws:events:<region>:<acct>:connection/connect-<vendor>[-<profile>]
      authorization_type: "BASIC" | "API_KEY" | "OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS";
      status: "AUTHORIZED" | "AUTHORIZING" | "DEAUTHORIZED" | "AUTHORIZATION_ERROR";
    }
  >;
};
```

`gsi1` (`type / vendor_name`) supports list-by-vendor; `gsi2` (`gsi2pk`) supports cross-cutting lookups (e.g. `state_machine_name → flow row`).

### 6.6 Token row (DDB)

```ts
type TokenRow = {
  pk: `TOKEN#${string}`;                // token_name
  sk: "v0";
  token_name: string;
  token_value: string;                  // KMS-encrypted; never logged
  extra?: Record<string, unknown>;
};
```

### 6.7 SFTP poller request / response (`SftpPoller`)

```ts
type SftpPollerRequest = {
  vendor_name: string;                   // resolves connector_id via FlowsRepository when absent
  connector_id?: string;                 // AWS::Transfer::Connector connectorId; overrides vendor lookup
  remote_directory: string;              // "/inbox" or partner-specific path
  target_bucket?: string;                // defaults to SFTP_LISTINGS_BUCKET
  target_prefix?: string;                // appended to SFTP_INBOUND_PREFIX/<vendor>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/
  transfer_concurrency?: number;         // 1..50, defaults to SFTP_DEFAULT_TRANSFER_CONCURRENCY
  direction?: "inbound" | "outbound";    // defaults to "inbound"
  send_paths?: string[];                 // required when direction="outbound"
  dry_run?: boolean;                     // list-only, no StartFileTransfer
  runId: string;                         // deterministic id; idempotency / log correlation
  x_sc_trace_id?: string;
};

type SftpPollerResponse =
  | {
      ok: true;
      listingId: string;
      listingS3Uri: `s3://${string}`;
      fileCount: number;
      sampledFiles: string[];            // first 25 deduped paths, for log/UI sampling
      transferIds: string[];             // empty when dry_run=true
      errors: Array<{
        path: string;
        type: "SftpTransferError" | "ThrottlingException";
        message: string;
        attempts: number;
      }>;                                 // bounded to 25 entries
    }
  | {
      ok: false;
      error: {
        type: "SftpListingTimeout" | "SftpTransferError" | "SftpConnectorNotConfigured";
        listingId?: string;
        listingS3Uri?: `s3://${string}`;
        message: string;
      };
    };
```

The shape is deliberately a strict superset of what `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Phase 4 step 10 calls "machine-readable results with counts, transfer IDs, listing location, and bounded errors." The `errors` array is **always bounded** so the response stays under the 256 KB Step Functions output limit even on a large failed listing.

## 7. Cross-cutting Concerns

### 7.1 Authentication & API-key hygiene

- All public mutating routes are API-key-gated — API Gateway enforces the `x-api-key` header against the Bootstrap-managed shared tenant Usage Plan. Connect's custom resource only attaches this API stage to that shared plan; it does not create a plan or bind an API key. `INVALID_API_KEY` returns the canonical `{"url": ".../get-started", "message": "This key is not valid for this service."}` payload.
- Webhooks bypass the API key and rely on the partner's `webhook_auth.Secret` for authentication. The router still surfaces `event.requestContext.identity.apiKey` (the originating product's API key) so health metrics keep their attribution.
- `HealthApiKeyAuthorizer` is a separate Lambda authoriser that accepts **either** the service API key **or** the upstream `HEALTH_API_KEY_ID` — used by intra-platform health endpoints.
- Secrets (API keys, partner credentials, tokens) are **never** logged. The Powertools `Logger` is wrapped with a `redactPaths(['credentials', 'passed_credentials', 'token_value', 'api_key', 'x-api-key', 'webhook_auth.Secret'])` middleware enforced in unit tests (per `cloud-aws-primary` non-negotiable #5).

### 7.2 Tracing & logging

- Each request gets an `x-sc-trace-id` (UUID) emitted in response headers and recorded in every CloudWatch log entry. The shared `withRequestContext()` middleware (`lambda/http/request-context.ts`) binds it on entry; outbound vendor callers (`callVendorApi`) and the reply-back POST forward `X-Sc-Trace-Id` so downstream systems can correlate.
- **Powertools Tracer** (X-Ray) is enabled on every Lambda — `tracer.captureLambdaHandler(handler)` and `tracer.captureAWSv3Client(...)` for every AWS SDK client.
- **Powertools Logger** is JSON-only (`POWERTOOLS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO`). Each handler binds Lambda context once, appends a request-scoped key (`creation_id`, `job_id`, `batch_execution_id`, `request_id`, `task_token`, `vendor_name`, `flow_name`), and resets the keys in `finally`.
- **Powertools Metrics** are emitted with namespace `connect`. Buffered counters: `jobs_started`, `jobs_completed`, `jobs_failed`, `jobs_redrive_requested`, `jobs_redriven`, `jobs_redrive_rejected`, `webhooks_received`, `webhooks_resolved`, `partner_call_errors`, `sftp_listings_started`, `sftp_listings_completed`, `sftp_listings_timed_out`, `sftp_files_transferred`, `sftp_transfer_errors`, with dimensions `{vendor_name, flow_name, status}` (and `direction ∈ inbound|outbound` for SFTP counters). The buffer is flushed in the API handler's `finally` block and in every worker's `finally` block. **Every metric MUST be registered in the Lexicon product's `cloudwatch-metrics.json` artifact and surfaced on the [Main Dashboard](https://github.com/Spring-Oaks-Capital-LLC/main-dashboard) before merge** (per `observability-metrics`).

### 7.3 Retry classification

A shared classifier (`lambda/utils/retry.ts`) inspects the lower-cased error name + message and returns `{ retriable, shouldReconnect, retryClass }`:


| Scope                          | Classification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Permanent partner-side errors surface as bounded entries in `errors[]` rather than failing the whole listing. |


### 7.4 Connection management

- All AWS SDK clients are **module-level singletons** (`lambda/aws/clients.ts`) so cold starts pay the connection cost only once.
- **Outbound partner HTTP is issued by Step Functions itself**, not by Lambda. Native HTTP Tasks (`arn:aws:states:::http:invoke`, §5.8) handle TLS, connection reuse inside the AWS-managed network, and authentication (via the bound EventBridge `Connection`). Lambdas no longer hold the partner credentials; only EventBridge does.
- For the residual Lambda HTTP workers (multipart, blob, file streaming, static-IP-bound), outbound HTTP uses `**undici`** with a process-wide `Agent` (`new Agent({ keepAliveTimeout: 60_000, keepAliveMaxTimeout: 600_000 })`). For SigV4-signed cross-service calls, `aws4` signs the headers before they hit `undici`.
- Multipart variants stream a remote `blob_url` via the response `Readable` so they fit in the worker's 1 GB memory.
- **SFTP egress is not direct.** No worker opens an outbound SSH socket; every SFTP byte travels via `@aws-sdk/client-transfer` against an `AWS::Transfer::Connector`. This keeps long-lived TCP/SSH sessions out of Lambda and lets AWS handle host-key trust and credential rotation.

### 7.5 Data-size safeguards

- `serializeFlowInput` rejects payloads ≥ `JOB_INPUT_MAX_BYTES` (256 KiB) with `413 JobInputTooLarge` before they reach Step Functions.
- The runtime `ReplyBackWorker` separately translates `States.DataLimitExceeded` and `States.Runtime` into the canonical `Connect.DataLimitExceeded` / `Connect.Runtime` errors with structured `errorMessage`, JSONPath context, and originating state.
- Async creation objects (flow / lookup definitions) are stored on S3 to bypass the 256 KB SFN input limit during compilation; the compilation lambdas read them by `creation_id`.

### 7.6 Resource hygiene & isolation boundaries

- **No in-process code sandbox.** Connect does not host arbitrary user-supplied code; nothing in the Lambda fleet imports `node:vm`, `vm2`, `isolated-vm`, or `eval`-style primitives.
- **No in-process SSH client.** SFTP traffic is mediated by AWS Transfer Family connectors (§2.3.7, §5.6); the partner's host-key trust, credential storage (Secrets Manager), and connection lifecycle are AWS's responsibility, not ours.
- **Per-partner secret isolation.** Each SFTP partner has its own Secrets Manager entry; the Transfer Family connector role is the only principal allowed to read it. `SftpPoller` itself never holds `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` and therefore cannot exfiltrate credentials even on a buggy code path.
- **Proxy-link resource hygiene.** The dynamically minted proxy-link API resources (`/proxy-links/...`) are scoped to the build instance ID and purged on every deploy by `ProxyResourceCleanupCustomResource` to prevent leaks.
- **Webhook secrets** (`webhook_auth.Secret`) and **partner credentials** are encrypted at rest under `DataKey` and redacted on the way out by the Powertools `Logger` middleware (§7.1). Connect's credential vault is the canonical owner for partner credentials; Account does not store or retrieve them.

### 7.7 Service / module structure

The implementation organises behaviour as small services with a clear interface and a swap-in test double. The shape is intentionally framework-light so it can be reproduced in any DI style (constructor injection, factory functions, or a runtime container):

- Each service has a **typed API** (a TypeScript interface), a **runtime factory** that closes over its dependencies (clients, configs, clocks, ID generators), and a **live binding** that wires real AWS SDK clients + env-var-derived config.
- Complex services (`FlowsRepository`, `PartnerConfigurationsRepository`, `TokensRepository`, `FlowCompiler`, `WebhookConditionEvaluator`, `BatchInputPreparer`, `WidgetService`, `ProxyLinkManager`, `SftpConnectorRegistry`, etc.) expose pure-function factories (`makeXxxService(runtime)`) so tests can pass mocks (in-memory clients, fixed clocks, deterministic UUIDs).
- Errors are **structured tagged classes** (`class FlowSpecValidationError extends ConnectError { readonly _tag = "FlowSpecValidationError" }`) so the HTTP layer can `switch` on them when mapping to status codes.
- Composition is split per route (§4.15) to keep config requirements minimal — a missing env var for an unrelated route must never fail this route.

### 7.8 Testing strategy

- **Vitest** is the test runner (per `testing-strategy`); coverage via `@vitest/coverage-v8` is required ≥ 80 % for new modules.
- Unit tests live in `test/unit/`** and follow the testing pyramid — mock AWS SDK clients at the `@aws-sdk/`* boundary using `vitest.mock(...)`; do **not** mock our own service interfaces.
- A real Step Functions Local container (`docker run amazon/aws-stepfunctions-local`) is used in tests that exercise the compiled ASL. `just test` orchestrates docker + Vitest.
- Integration tests live in `test/integration/connect-api.test.ts` and hit a deployed stage via `aws4`-signed `x-api-key` requests (`CONNECT_API_URL`, `AWS_PROFILE`, `SERVICE_API_KEY`).
- The OpenAPI spec at `docs/openapi.json` is regenerated by `scripts/generate-openapi.ts` (driven from `lambda/api/definitions.ts`) and checked in. CI fails if `docs/openapi.json` is stale.
- Powertools `Logger.injectLambdaContext` and `Tracer.captureLambdaHandler` are wrapped in test setup so log + trace assertions survive across test files.

### 7.9 CI / CD

- `.github/workflows/ci-cd-dev.yml` (PRs to `main`, `TARGET_ENV=dev`) and `.github/workflows/ci-cd-prod.yml` (push to `main`, `TARGET_ENV=prod`) call the shared reusable workflows. The repo `justfile` exposes the contract recipes (`just check`, `just test`, `just cdk:synth`, `just cdk:deploy`).
- `pnpm` is the package manager. `pnpm check` runs the TypeScript compiler in build mode (`tsc -b`). `pnpm lint` uses ESLint; `pnpm format` uses Prettier with import sort.
- Husky hooks run `lint-staged` on commit.
- All deploys go through `cdk deploy` with `--require-approval=any-change` in dev and `--require-approval=broadening` in prod. **No alternative IaC tool is permitted in CI** (per non-negotiable #4).

## 8. Operational Playbook

### 8.1 Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (Lambda runtime is 24).
- pnpm.
- AWS CLI / CDK with permissions for VPC, EC2 (subnets, EIP, NAT), Lambda, Step Functions, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB (with KMS), IAM, CloudFormation, CloudWatch Logs, SSM, **AWS Transfer Family** (`transfer:`* for connector + listing + transfer), **Secrets Manager** (per-partner SFTP credentials), and **EventBridge Scheduler** (per-partner SFTP polling cadence). Deploy region is supplied by the installer/deployer context; Connect does not hardcode a default region.
- Pre-provisioned `Subdomain` (Bootstrap-created API Gateway REST custom domain with Connect's `AWS::ApiGateway::BasePathMapping` under `/connector-jobs`).
- Pre-created shared tenant Usage Plan id at `/account/shared-usage-plan-id` and pre-issued `HEALTH_API_KEY_ID` (forwarded by the deployer through CDK context).
- SFTP partner connectors are configured after deploy through `PUT/PATCH /vendors/{vendor_name}/sftp`; the Marketplace bundle remains tenant-agnostic and carries no partner hostnames, connector ids, secret ARNs, directories, schedules, or concurrency caps.

### 8.2 Deploy / destroy

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm cdk:synth
pnpm cdk:deploy           # NetworkStack first (CDK auto-orders), then ConnectStack
pnpm cdk:destroy          # only when deletionProtection=false (non-prod)
```

Stack outputs: `ApiUrl`, `FlowCreationStateMachineArn`, `LookupCreationStateMachineArn`, `FlowDecoratorStateMachineArn`, `BatchInvocationStateMachineArn`, `EnableStaticIpStateMachineArn`, `DisableStaticIpStateMachineArn`, `RuntimeStateMachineRoleArn`, `SftpPollerLambdaArn`, `SftpConnectorIds` (map of `vendor_name → connectorId`), `VpcId`. Three SSM parameters are created: `connect-api-url`, `connect-flow-decorator-arn`, and `connect-sftp-connector-map`.

### 8.3 Smoke tests

After every deploy run the seven release-validation calls listed in `README.md` §"Connect release validation":

1. `POST /vendors` to create a throw-away partner; `DELETE /vendors/{name}` to remove it.
2. `POST /vendors/{name}/flows` with a no-op spec (`Pass → Wait 1 → ReplyBack`); poll `GET /flows/creations/{creation_id}` until `SUCCEEDED`.
3. `POST /vendors/{name}/flows/{flow}/jobs` with a stub `callback_url` (a webhook.site capture) and confirm the callback arrives.
4. `POST /vendors/{name}/flows/{flow}/webhook` to verify the inbound path (after wiring a `WebhookReference` step in the spec).
5. `POST /tokens/<name>` + `GET /tokens/<name>` + `DELETE /tokens/<name>` to validate the token registry.
6. `GET /network/ip` to confirm the EIP fabric reports its current state.
7. **SFTP listing-first live check** (per `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Phase 5, never skipped on a fresh connector):
  1. Confirm the partner secret exists with the expected `{Url, Username, Password}` (or `PrivateKey`) keys.
  2. Confirm `VendorsResponsesBucket` is writable under `transfer-listings/<vendor>/`.
  3. `POST /vendors/{name}/sftp/test-connection` with `dry_run=true` and verify a `transfer-listings/<vendor>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<runId>/listing.json` artifact appears in S3.
  4. Drop one known small file in the partner's remote directory; rerun `POST /vendors/{name}/sftp/test-connection` with `dry_run=false` and confirm the file lands under `sftp-inbound/<vendor>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/`.
  5. Inspect `SftpPoller` logs for auth, path, permission, networking, and throttling errors. Do **not** claim the connection works unless this live transfer succeeded.

For request signing the README ships a `bash`/`zsh` `awscurl` helper that wraps `aws4` for signed `execute-api` requests.

### 8.4 Rollback

1. `git checkout <last-known-good>` and `pnpm cdk:deploy` — keeps DynamoDB tables and S3 buckets in place.
2. Re-run the smoke checks.
3. Audit `FlowsTable` for any rows whose `state_machine_name` references a now-missing dynamic SFN; the next compilation overwrites them. Confirm no jobs are stuck in `IN_PROGRESS` past `now - 1h` via `aws stepfunctions list-executions --status-filter RUNNING` against `FlowDecoratorStateMachineArn`.

### 8.5 Common runbook items

- `**States.DataLimitExceeded` cascades**: a partner returned a payload above the declared inline contract or the spec attempted to hand a full payload across a state. Use `ResponseMode: "S3"` / `SaveResponseToFile=true` so the compiler emits a streaming HTTP worker and only an S3 reference crosses state boundaries.
- **Stuck `WAIT_FOR_TASK_TOKEN`**: inspect `FlowsTable` for the `REQUEST#<request_id>` row. Confirm the partner ever called the webhook URL. If the row exists but the SFN is gone, `processWebhook` will return `CannotContinueFlowCorruptState`.
- **Throttled `ListExecutions`**: `ThrottlingException` from Step Functions surfaces as `429 TooManyRequests`. Backoff-and-retry on the caller side; do not raise the per-stage Step Functions limit without sign-off.
- **EIP provisioning hung in `ENABLING_PENDING`**: `EnableStaticIp` retries `CreateNatGateway` up to 10 times exponentially; if still failing, manually release the half-created EIP, untag the partial subnet, and re-trigger.
- `**SftpListingTimeout**`: `DescribeDirectoryListing` did not reach `COMPLETED` within `SFTP_LISTING_MAX_WAIT_MS`. Check the connector's CloudWatch Logs (`/aws/transfer/connector/<connectorId>`) for auth, host-key, or path errors. Confirm the partner's host keys still match the trusted fingerprints on the connector — partner-side key rotation is the most common cause.
- `**SftpTransferError` after retries**: `StartFileTransfer` exhausted `SFTP_TRANSFER_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`. Pull the offending paths from the response's `errors[]`, validate the partner's remote ACL, and re-run `POST /vendors/{vendor}/sftp/test-connection` with the narrowed `remote_directory`. Lower `transfer_concurrency` if the partner is rate-limiting us.
- **Recurring SFTP poll missed**: confirm the EventBridge `Schedule` is enabled (`scheduler:GetSchedule`) and that its target invocation role still has `lambda:InvokeFunction` on `SftpPollerLambdaArn`. The `sftp_listings_started` metric, dimension `vendor_name`, alarms when no invocation lands inside the partner's expected cadence.

## 9. Re-creation Checklist (in order)

1. **Repo skeleton**: pnpm workspace, TypeScript, `tsconfig.{base,build,app,src,test}.json`, ESLint, Prettier (with import sort), husky + lint-staged, Vitest. Package name is internal.
2. **Runtime dependencies**: `@aws-lambda-powertools/{logger,tracer,metrics,parameters}`, `@aws-sdk/client-{dynamodb,s3,sfn,apigateway,ec2,kms,lambda,ssm,sts,transfer,secrets-manager,scheduler,eventbridge}`, `@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`, `@smithy/{config-resolver,node-config-provider,protocol-http,signature-v4}`, `aws4`, `zod`, `zod-to-json-schema`, `undici`, `fast-xml-parser`, `csv-parse`, `csv-stringify`. CDK: `aws-cdk-lib`, `constructs`, `aws-cdk`. **No `ssh2`, `ssh2-sftp-client`, `vm2`, `isolated-vm`, Python dependencies, Serverless Framework, SAM, Terraform, or Pulumi.**
3. **Schemas / contracts**: one Zod module per group in `lambda/schemas/` — `vendor`, `vendor-credentials`, `partner-configuration`, `flow`, `lookup`, `flow-spec`, `flow-invoke`, `batch`, `redrive`, `webhook`, `token`, `static-ip`, `sftp`, `errors`. Errors are tagged classes; everything else is type+validator pairs.
4. **Utils**: `lambda/utils/{xml-converter,jsonpath,sigv4,retry,errors,duration,size-guard}.ts`.
5. **Configuration**: `lambda/config/{env,sfn,kms,api-gateway,sftp}.ts` plus per-service config readers tied to the env vars listed in §2.4. Required vars must throw at startup; optional vars must default per §2.4.
6. **Services** (one file each in `lambda/services/`): `FlowsRepository`, `PartnerConfigurationsRepository`, `TokensRepository`, `CredentialVaultService`, `EventBridgeConnectionRegistry`, `FlowCompiler` (with sub-modules `transformation`, `authorization`, `dry-run`, `creation-and-saving`, `compiler/{const,parameters,to-vendor,general,map-state,lambda-arns,dynamicity-switcher,instructions}`), `WebhookConditionEvaluator`, `WebhookErrorCodes`, `BatchInputPreparer`, `BatchPostProcessor`, `ExecutionRedriveService`, `WidgetService`, `ProxyLinkManager`, `S3CreationStore`, `SftpConnectorRegistry`, `HealthMetricClient`, `MetricsBuffer`, plus a composition module `services/index.ts` that exports per-router and per-handler dependency containers.
7. **Workers** (one file each in `lambda/workers/`): one per `Type` in §3.5.1 — `post-multipart`, `put-multipart`, `post-blob`, `put-blob`, `post-base64`, `post-form-url-encoded`, `get-file`, `widget`, `link-transformation`, `progressive-waiting`, `token-management-get`, `token-management-set`, `fake-range-creator`, `process-fail-states`, `reply-back`, `dry-run`, `get-credentials`, `get-authorization`, `token-management-auth`, `send-health-metric`, `cleanup-apigw`, plus the streaming/static-IP HTTP workers described in §5.9. Each worker imports `tracer.captureLambdaHandler` and `logger.injectLambdaContext`.
8. **SFTP fabric**: `lambda/sftp/poller.ts` (`SftpPoller`, listing-first per `build-inbound-sftp-workflows`), `lambda/sftp/connector-config.ts` (runtime per-partner config loader from `FlowsTable`), and route/service modules that create/import/update/delete AWS Transfer Family connectors plus EventBridge schedules at runtime. No CDK construct mints per-partner connectors in the pre-synthesized bundle.
9. **Compilation pipeline**: `lambda/flow-creation/{transform-flow,transform-lookup,add-pass-through,add-call-api,add-call-token-management,add-credentials,add-dry-run,validate-asl,create-runtime-state-machine,update-runtime-state-machine,save-flow}.ts`.
10. **Static-IP fabric**: `lambda/static-ip/{ec2-common/{eip,nat,internet,subnet,route,tag-transformers}.ts, handlers/{create,delete,process-errors}.ts}` and the two ASL definitions assembled in CDK via `sfn.StateMachine.fromString(...)`.
11. **HTTP layer**: `lambda/http/{request-context.ts, responses.ts}`, `lambda/logging/{powertools.ts, runtime.ts}`, the per-route routers (partners, credentials, configurations, constructor, jobs, batch, webhooks, tokens, static-ip, **sftp**), and `lambda/http/router.ts` mounting them with `prefix="/"`, then `lambda/handler.ts`.
12. **OpenAPI generator**: `lambda/api/definitions.ts` and `scripts/generate-openapi.ts`. `pnpm api:spec` writes `docs/openapi.json` (the generated spec is checked in).
13. **CDK stacks**: `lib/network-stack.ts` and `lib/connect-stack.ts` per §2.2 and §2.3, then `bin/app.ts`. Add a `cost-tagging` aspect that stamps `sc:service:name=connect` and `sc:product:name=Connect` on every taggable resource. The CDK app must not read SFTP partner config from `cdk.json`; partner-specific SFTP values enter only through runtime APIs.
14. **Custom resources (CDK `AwsCustomResource` or Lambda-backed)**: `ApiUsagePlanStageAttachmentCustomResource`, `ApiGatewayLogCustomResource`, `ProxyResourceCleanupCustomResource`, `HealthApiKeyAuthorizer`.
15. **Local Step Functions**: `scripts/start-stepfunctions-local.sh`, `setupTests.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `justfile` (`just test` orchestrates docker + vitest), and a CI caller wired to the shared workflows.
16. **Lexicon + Dashboard registration**: every metric introduced in §7.2 MUST land in the Lexicon product's `cloudwatch-metrics.json` artifact and on the [Main Dashboard](https://github.com/Spring-Oaks-Capital-LLC/main-dashboard) **in the same PR cycle** (per `observability-metrics`).
17. **Smoke tests**: replicate the seven release-validation steps from §8.3 in the integration suite under `test/integration`, including the `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Phase 5 live listing-and-transfer check.

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

A re-implementation is considered functionally complete when:

- All endpoints in §1.2 return the documented success/error envelopes for the example payloads in `README.md` and the OpenAPI spec.
- Creating a flow with `authorization.credentials ∈ {preset,static,dynamic}` × `authorization.mode ∈ {pass_through,call_api,token_management}` always lands on a real, validated runtime state machine.
- A flow that contains a `Fail` state always closes with a callback POST to `callback_url` carrying `job_status=Failed`, the canonicalised cause, and the matching status code.
- A flow that contains a `WAIT_FOR_TASK_TOKEN` step compiles to `arn:aws:states:::aws-sdk:dynamodb:putItem.waitForTaskToken`, creates the pending `REQUEST#<request_id>` row before waiting, is resolvable via the inbound webhook route, and survives the full `WebhookErrorCode → custom-status mapping` matrix in §3.7 / §6.1.
- `POST /vendors/{vendor_name}/flows/{flow_name}/jobs/{job_id}/redrive` and `POST /batch-executions/{batch_execution_id}/redrive` call Step Functions `RedriveExecution` on the existing STANDARD execution ARN, never start a replacement execution, expose `redrive` metadata through status/history APIs, and reject non-redrivable executions with `409 ExecutionNotRedrivable`.
- Batch executions paginate per-item outputs back to S3 and surface accurate per-status counts via the aggregation API.
- Async flow inputs ≥ 256 KiB are rejected at the API layer with `413 JobInputTooLarge` before reaching Step Functions.
- The ASL validator catches every spec the compiler can emit; specs that pass validation can always be installed via `CreateStateMachine` / `UpdateStateMachine`.
- The compilation SFN never leaks half-created runtime SFNs: any failure inside `CreateRuntimeStateMachine` / `UpdateRuntimeStateMachine` lands on `FailState`, and the next `PUT` succeeds without manual cleanup.
- Partner credentials are owned by Connect: `GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /vendors/{vendor_name}/credentials` and `…/passed-credentials` store encrypted values locally, never call Account or a legacy Account Manager endpoint, and keep EventBridge Connection ARNs in sync with the `credentials` bucket.
- Tokens persisted via `POST /tokens` are returned with `extra` intact and decryptable by both `TokenManagementGetWorker` and the partner-call helper that resolves `auth_type ∈ {bearer,api_key}` via `token_name`.
- `processWebhook` always returns within `30 s`, always emits a silent health metric, and always honours the per-flow `webhook_response_mapping` overrides.
- Static-IP enable/disable is idempotent: repeated `POST /network/ip` does not create duplicate NAT/EIP resources, and `GET` correctly reports `ENABLING_PENDING` / `ENABLED` / `DISABLED_OR_NEVER_CREATED`.
- Deploy-time custom resources (`ApiUsagePlan`, `ApiGatewayLog`, `ProxyResourceCleanup`) leave the API stage in a clean state on every deploy.
- **No in-process code execution.** `grep -r "node:vm\|vm2\|isolated-vm\|eval(" lambda/` returns zero hits, and a spec submission containing a `Type` outside the §3.5.1 dispatch table is rejected at compile time with `400 FlowSpecValidationError`.
- **Step Functions is the only workflow runtime.** Every flow / lookup compiles to a Step Functions state machine; the repo contains no in-Lambda step orchestrator, no SQS-chained "workflow worker", and no second compiler target. `grep -r "executeWorkflow\|runFlow\|stepLoop" lambda/` returns zero hits outside Step Functions integration code.
- **Outbound HTTP defaults to a native Step Functions HTTP Task.** Compiling a `HTTP_JSON` (or any other plain HTTP-shaped task type — `HTTP_XML`, `HTTP_ANY`, `GET_JSON`, `POST_JSON`, `PUT_JSON`, `DELETE_JSON`, `GET_XML`, `POST_XML`, `DELETE_XML`, `POST_BASE64`, `POST_FORM_URL_ENCODED`) emits a Task with `Resource: "arn:aws:states:::http:invoke"` whose `Authentication.ConnectionArn` references an `AWS::Events::Connection`. The compiled ASL contains **no `lambda:invoke` against an HTTP worker** for these task types — verified by an ASL-introspection unit test that compiles a representative spec per type and asserts the resulting `Resource` strings.
- **Lambda HTTP workers are limited to the residual set.** `lambda/workers/` contains only `post-multipart`, `put-multipart`, `post-blob`, `put-blob`, `get-file`, the two static-IP HTTP variants, and the `FormEncodeWorker` fallback. The HTTP_JSON / HTTP_XML / HTTP_ANY / GET_JSON / POST_JSON / PUT_JSON / DELETE_JSON / GET_XML / POST_XML / DELETE_XML / POST_BASE64 / POST_FORM_URL_ENCODED Lambda files are **absent** — `find lambda/workers/ -name 'http-*.ts' -o -name 'get-json.ts' -o -name 'post-json.ts'` returns nothing.
- **Authorisation lives on EventBridge Connections.** Every partner with HTTP endpoints has at least one `AWS::Events::Connection` named `connect-<vendor_name>[-<auth_profile>]`; deleting a partner deletes its connections. `RuntimeStateMachineRole` carries `events:RetrieveConnectionCredentials` (and the matching `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`) only for the connection ARNs the runtime state machine references — verified by IAM simulation in CI.
- **SFN HTTP Task IAM is host-scoped.** The `RuntimeStateMachineRole`'s `states:InvokeHTTPEndpoint` statement carries a `states:HTTPEndpoint` condition listing only the hostnames the compiled flow targets; an attempt to invoke a host outside that allow-list at runtime fails with `States.Http.AccessDenied`.
- **SFTP traffic goes exclusively through AWS Transfer Family.** A spec containing `Type: "SFTP"` compiles to a `LambdaInvoke` of `SftpPoller` with the §6.7 contract; `grep -r "ssh2\|ssh2-sftp-client\|node-ssh" lambda/ package.json` returns zero hits.
- **The SFTP listing-first flow is preserved.** Every SFTP run produces a `transfer-listings/<vendor>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<runId>/listing.json` artifact in S3 **before** any `StartFileTransfer` is issued (per `build-inbound-sftp-workflows` Principle 3). `dry_run=true` runs return `transferIds: []` and write the listing artifact only.
- **SFTP results are deterministic and machine-readable.** Successful transfers land at `sftp-inbound/<vendor>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<remote-path>`. The response shape (`SftpPollerResponse`) is constant across success and partial-failure runs, with `errors[]` bounded to 25 entries so the payload stays under the 256 KB SFN-output limit.
- **SFTP retries** on `ThrottlingException` / 5xx are bounded by `SFTP_TRANSFER_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`; permanent partner-side errors surface as bounded entries in `errors[]` rather than failing the entire listing.
- **SFTP partner values are never hardcoded.** Hostnames, secret ARNs, remote directories, target prefixes, schedules, and concurrency caps live in `cdk.json` context (CDK-time) or in the invocation event (runtime). `grep -r "sftp://" lambda/ lib/` matches nothing outside `cdk.json` / Secrets Manager references.
- All Lambdas use `nodejs24.x`, ARM64, ESM bundling, and the `createRequire` banner so any CommonJS dependency works at runtime. **Zero Python files exist in the repository.**
- All LLM interactions (if any) go through the **Vercel AI SDK (`ai`) with strict TypeScript and Zod tool schemas** — `grep -r "openai\|@anthropic-ai/sdk\|@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime" lambda/` returns zero hits.
- IAM permissions follow least-privilege per §2.3.6: in particular, `SftpPoller` does **not** hold `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` (only the per-partner Transfer Family connector role does).
- Every metric emitted by the service exists in the Lexicon product's `cloudwatch-metrics.json` artifact and is rendered on the Main Dashboard — including the `sftp_listings_started` / `sftp_listings_completed` / `sftp_listings_timed_out` / `sftp_files_transferred` / `sftp_transfer_errors` family.
- All structured logs include the relevant `creation_id` / `job_id` / `batch_execution_id` / `request_id` / `task_token` / `vendor_name` / `flow_name` / `connector_id` / `runId` / `listingId` / `x-sc-trace-id` so an operator can trace a single integration call end-to-end via CloudWatch Logs Insights, and **never** include credentials, tokens, `webhook_auth.Secret`, or partner SFTP passwords.

## 11. Worked Examples

End-to-end request / response cycles for every public capability. All bodies are real shapes the API accepts (validated by Zod) — copy-paste-ready against a deployed stage. Example partner: `acme-bureau`. Headers shown only when material; every authenticated request also carries `x-api-key: <SERVICE_API_KEY>` and `x-sc-trace-id: <uuid>`.

### 11.1 Create a partner

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: <SERVICE_API_KEY>

{ "vendor_name": "acme-bureau", "company_id": "tenant-001" }
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{ "vendor_name": "acme-bureau", "company_id": "tenant-001" }
```

### 11.2 Set partner credentials

```http
PUT /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/credentials
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "items": {
    "client_id": "ak_live_abc123",
    "client_secret": "sk_live_xyz789",
    "auth_url": "https://api.acme-bureau.com/oauth/token"
  }
}
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{ "client_id": "ak_live_abc123", "client_secret": "sk_live_xyz789", "auth_url": "https://api.acme-bureau.com/oauth/token" }
```

### 11.3 Create a flow — credit-pull example

A representative real-world spec: OAuth-token fetch → POST a credit pull → progressive-wait until ready → GET the report file → reply back.

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/flows
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "flow_name": "pull-credit-report",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "configuration_id": "cfg-prod-001",
  "authorization": {
    "credentials": "preset",
    "mode": "call_api",
    "header_name": "Authorization",
    "scheme": "bearer",
    "call_api": {
      "url": "$vendor_credentials.auth_url",
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
      "request_payload": "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=$vendor_credentials.client_id&client_secret=$vendor_credentials.client_secret",
      "path_to_token": "$.access_token"
    }
  },
  "definition": {
    "StartAt": "SubmitPull",
    "States": {
      "SubmitPull": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "ResourceDefinition": {
          "Type": "HTTP_JSON",
          "URL": "https://api.acme-bureau.com/v2/credit-pulls",
          "Method": "POST",
          "ContentType": "application/json",
          "RequestPayload": "$.request_payload",
          "SaveOutputTo": "$.pull"
        },
        "Next": "WaitForReady"
      },
      "WaitForReady": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "ResourceDefinition": {
          "Type": "PROGRESSIVE_WAITING",
          "WaitingConditions": { "IntervalSeconds": 5, "MaxAttempts": 24, "BackoffRate": 1.5 }
        },
        "Next": "CheckStatus"
      },
      "CheckStatus": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "ResourceDefinition": {
          "Type": "GET_JSON",
          "URL": "https://api.acme-bureau.com/v2/credit-pulls/{pull_id}",
          "PathParameters": { "pull_id": "$.pull.id" },
          "SaveOutputTo": "$.status"
        },
        "Next": "IsReady"
      },
      "IsReady": {
        "Type": "Choice",
        "Choices": [
          { "Variable": "$.status.state", "StringEquals": "READY", "Next": "DownloadReport" },
          { "Variable": "$.status.state", "StringEquals": "FAILED", "Next": "ReportFailed" }
        ],
        "Default": "WaitForReady"
      },
      "DownloadReport": {
        "Type": "Task",
        "ResourceDefinition": {
          "Type": "GET_FILE",
          "URL": "$.status.report_url",
          "SaveOutputTo": "$.response_payload"
        },
        "End": true
      },
      "ReportFailed": { "Type": "Fail", "Cause": "Acme bureau reported FAILED" }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

{ "creation_id": "8f1c8a91-3a47-4f1c-9e6f-ad9f8b5e6f10", "creation_status": "Started" }
```

### 11.4 Poll flow compilation status

```http
GET /connector-jobs/flows/creations/8f1c8a91-3a47-4f1c-9e6f-ad9f8b5e6f10
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{ "status": "SUCCEEDED" }
```

On failure the body carries the structured cause:

```json
{ "status": "FAILED", "error": "FlowSpecValidationError", "cause": "State `WaitForReady` references unknown ResourceDefinition.Type" }
```

### 11.5 Invoke a flow (job)

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/flows/pull-credit-report/jobs
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "transaction_id": "txn-2026-05-04-0001",
  "request_collection_id": "applicant-9001",
  "response_collection_id": "credit-report-9001",
  "callback_url": "https://api.staircase.co/integration-bus/connect/callback",
  "request_payload": {
    "applicant": { "ssn": "XXX-XX-9001", "dob": "1985-04-12" },
    "products": ["fico_8", "tradelines"]
  },
  "partner_configuration": { "partner_configuration_id": "cfg-prod-001" }
}
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

{ "job_id": "5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f", "job_status": "Started" }
```

If the spec set `contains_widget: true`, the response also carries `"widget_url": "https://…/widgets/acme-bureau/pull-credit-report<uuid>.html?X-Amz-Signature=…"`.

### 11.6 Reply-back callback (delivered to `callback_url`)

When the flow finishes, Connect POSTs the canonical callback envelope to the URL supplied at job submission (with `x-api-key: <originating product key>` and `X-Sc-Trace-Id`):

```json
POST <callback_url>
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: <originating product key>
X-Sc-Trace-Id: <uuid>

{
  "webhook_type": "flow_completion",
  "job_id": "5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f",
  "job_status": "Completed",
  "transaction_id": "txn-2026-05-04-0001",
  "request_collection_id": "applicant-9001",
  "response_collection_id": "credit-report-9001",
  "response_payload": {
    "report_url": "https://<connect-bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/5e8b1a07-…/report.pdf?X-Amz-Signature=…",
    "fico_8": 742,
    "tradelines": [/* … */]
  },
  "status_code": 200
}
```

On failure the body shape is identical with `job_status: "Failed"`, `status_code` set to the canonical mapping (e.g. `502` for `CallVendorError`), and `response_payload: { "Error": "CallVendorError.503", "Cause": { "errorMessage": "Acme bureau returned HTTP 503", "status_code": 503 } }`.

### 11.7 Inspect job execution status

```http
GET /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/flows/pull-credit-report/jobs/5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f?detailed=true&max_results=50
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "status": "RUNNING",
  "start_date": "2026-05-04T15:01:22.114Z",
  "end_date": null,
  "duration": null,
  "executed_events": ["SubmitPull", "WaitForReady", "CheckStatus"],
  "last_event": "CheckStatus",
  "details": [
    { "event_id": 7, "event_type": "stateEnteredEventDetails", "event_name": "CheckStatus",
      "timestamp": "2026-05-04 15:01:48.312", "previous_event_id": 6,
      "input_details": { "applicant": { "ssn": "XXX-XX-9001", "dob": "1985-04-12" } } }
  ],
  "input":  { "transaction_id": "txn-2026-05-04-0001", "request_collection_id": "applicant-9001",
              "response_collection_id": "credit-report-9001", "callback_url": "https://…/callback" },
  "output": null,
  "redrive": {
    "count": 0,
    "date": null,
    "status": "NOT_REDRIVABLE",
    "status_reason": "Execution is RUNNING and cannot be redriven"
  }
}
```

### 11.8 Webhook from partner (releases `WAIT_FOR_TASK_TOKEN`)

The partner POSTs to the per-flow webhook URL. Connect authenticates via the per-flow `webhook_auth.Secret`, matches the `request_id`, and resolves the pending task token.

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/flows/pull-credit-report/webhook
Content-Type: application/json
X-Acme-Sig: shared-secret-value

{
  "event": "credit_pull.completed",
  "webhook": { "request_id": "req-9001", "status": "READY" },
  "report_url": "https://api.acme-bureau.com/files/report-9001.pdf"
}
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

{ "event": "credit_pull.completed", "webhook": { "request_id": "req-9001", "status": "READY" }, "report_url": "https://api.acme-bureau.com/files/report-9001.pdf" }
```

A mismatched `webhook_conditions` evaluates to `403 Conditions did not match.` (or the per-flow `WebhookResponseMapping.ConditionsMismatch.StatusCode`); a missing `request_id` evaluates to `400 NoRequestIdFoundInPayload`.

### 11.9 Stop a running job

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/flows/pull-credit-report/jobs/5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{ "job_id": "5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f", "status": "ABORTED", "stop_date": "2026-05-04 15:14:08.001" }
```

#### 11.9.1 Redrive an unsuccessful job

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/flows/pull-credit-report/jobs/5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f/redrive
Content-Type: application/json

{ "client_token": "retry-5e8b1a07-001" }
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

{
  "job_id": "5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f",
  "execution_arn": "arn:aws:states:us-east-2:123456789012:execution:connect-acme-pull-credit-report:5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f",
  "status": "RUNNING",
  "redrive_date": "2026-05-04T15:22:30.000Z",
  "redrive_count": 1
}
```

If Step Functions reports `NOT_REDRIVABLE`, Connect returns `409 ExecutionNotRedrivable` with the AWS `redriveStatusReason`, for example `Execution is SUCCEEDED and cannot be redriven` or `Execution redrivable period exceeded`.

### 11.10 Batch execution

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/flows/pull-credit-report/batch-executions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "callback_url": "https://api.staircase.co/integration-bus/connect/callback",
  "batch_input": { "data_source": "s3://staircase-batches/credit-pulls/2026-05-04/applicants.json" },
  "batch_configuration": { "maximum_concurrency": 25, "maximum_items_per_batch": 1 }
}
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

{ "batch_execution_id": "b7d2a44c-6c0a-4e22-9ad0-2f1d3e4a5b6c", "batch_execution_status": "Started" }
```

```http
GET /connector-jobs/batch-executions/b7d2a44c-6c0a-4e22-9ad0-2f1d3e4a5b6c/aggregation
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "batch_execution_status": "RUNNING",
  "batch_execution_id": "b7d2a44c-6c0a-4e22-9ad0-2f1d3e4a5b6c",
  "batch_execution_items_aggregation":
    { "pending": 0, "pending_redrive": 0, "running": 12, "succeeded": 88, "failed": 0, "timed_out": 0, "aborted": 0, "total": 100 },
  "batch_execution_executions_aggregation":
    { "pending": 0, "pending_redrive": 0, "running": 12, "succeeded": 88, "failed": 0, "timed_out": 0, "aborted": 0, "total": 100 }
}
```

### 11.11 SFTP — flow-driven step

For partners that drop files on SFTP, a flow embeds an `SFTP` task; the compiler turns it into a sync `LambdaInvoke` of `SftpPoller`.

```jsonc
// State inside FlowSpecDefinition.States
"PullDailyDrop": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "ResourceDefinition": {
    "Type": "SFTP",
    "Direction": "inbound",
    "RemoteDirectory": "/outbound/credit-reports",
    "TargetPrefix": "daily-pulls/",
    "TransferConcurrency": 10,
    "SaveOutputTo": "$.sftp_result"
  },
  "Next": "ProcessReports"
}
```

`$.sftp_result` after the step matches `SftpPollerResponse` (§6.7):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "listingId": "list-2026-05-04-0001",
  "listingS3Uri": "s3://vendors-responses-connect-…/transfer-listings/acme-bureau/2026/05/04/list-2026-05-04-0001/listing.json",
  "fileCount": 42,
  "sampledFiles": ["/outbound/credit-reports/2026-05-04/applicant-9001.pdf", "/outbound/credit-reports/2026-05-04/applicant-9002.pdf"],
  "transferIds": ["xfer-1a2b", "xfer-3c4d", "…"],
  "errors": []
}
```

### 11.12 SFTP — manual test connection

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/sftp/test-connection
Content-Type: application/json

{ "remote_directory": "/outbound/credit-reports", "dry_run": true }
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "listingId": "list-test-7e9c4f",
  "listingS3Uri": "s3://vendors-responses-connect-…/transfer-listings/acme-bureau/2026/05/04/test-7e9c4f/listing.json",
  "fileCount": 42,
  "sampledFiles": ["/outbound/credit-reports/2026-05-04/applicant-9001.pdf"],
  "transferIds": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

If the partner has no Transfer Family connector configured:

```json
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

{ "ok": false, "error": { "type": "SftpConnectorNotConfigured", "message": "Partner `acme-bureau` has no SFTP connector." } }
```

### 11.13 Lookup (synchronous request/response)

Lookups follow the same constructor surface as flows but compile to an `EXPRESS` SFN and return the response inline.

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/lookups/zip-to-state/jobs
Content-Type: application/json

{ "transaction_id": "txn-zip-001", "request_payload": { "zip": "94107" } }
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{ "transaction_id": "txn-zip-001", "response_payload": { "state": "CA", "city": "San Francisco" } }
```

A partner-side error:

```json
HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway

{ "transaction_id": "txn-zip-001",
  "error": "CallVendorError.503",
  "cause": { "errorMessage": "Acme bureau returned HTTP 503", "status_code": 503, "url": "https://api.acme-bureau.com/v1/zip/94107" } }
```

### 11.14 Tokens registry

```http
POST /connector-jobs/tokens/acme-oauth-token
Content-Type: application/json

{ "token_value": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp…", "extra": { "expires_at": "2026-05-04T16:30:00Z" } }
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{ "token_name": "acme-oauth-token", "token_value": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp…", "extra": { "expires_at": "2026-05-04T16:30:00Z" } }
```

```http
GET /connector-jobs/tokens/acme-oauth-token
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{ "token_name": "acme-oauth-token", "token_value": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp…", "extra": { "expires_at": "2026-05-04T16:30:00Z" } }
```

### 11.15 Static IP

```http
GET /connector-jobs/network/ip
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{ "ip": "3.142.55.108", "resource_status": { "elastic_ip": "ALLOCATED", "network_translator": "ENABLED" } }
```

```http
POST /connector-jobs/network/ip
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

{ "execution_arn": "arn:aws:states:<region>:123456789012:execution:EnableStaticIp:enable-2026-05-04T15-22-10",
  "status": "ENABLING_PENDING" }
```

### 11.16 Partner connectivity configuration (PCC)

```http
POST /connector-jobs/vendors/acme-bureau/configurations
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "partner_configuration_id": "cfg-prod-001",
  "partner_configuration": {
    "partner_configuration": {
      "credentials": { "client_id": "ak_prod_001", "client_secret": "sk_prod_001" },
      "passed_credentials": { "merchant_id": "M-9001" }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{ "partner_configuration_id": "cfg-prod-001" }
```

### 11.17 Response-URL recovery

```http
POST /connector-jobs/response-url-recovery
Content-Type: application/json

{ "job_id": "5e8b1a07-9c4d-4ec1-9f6a-1b3a2c5d4e7f", "expiration": 7200 }
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "page": { "count": 2 },
  "response_file_urls": [
    "https://vendors-responses-connect-….s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/5e8b1a07-…/report.pdf?X-Amz-Signature=…",
    "https://vendors-responses-connect-….s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/5e8b1a07-…/raw-response.json?X-Amz-Signature=…"
  ]
}
```

### 11.18 Error envelope (any route)

Every 4xx/5xx — except the API-Gateway-rendered ones in §3.1 — uses the canonical envelope:

```json
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
