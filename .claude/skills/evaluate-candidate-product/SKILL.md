# Evaluate Candidate Product

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill as the **evidence and functional-outcome phase**, after `evaluate-candidate-intent` has produced the intent, evidence model, gates, and weighting. Run it as a **dedicated subagent**. It answers the central question: **does working runtime, data, output, and demo evidence prove the story's intended outcome?** Evaluate the functional outcome **before** any implementation detail.

For assignment-specific evidence and access boundaries, consult `reference/assignment-evidence-catalogs.md`.

## Step 1 — Enforce the Gates (Failed / Blocked / Hard Fail)

Check the gates from `evaluate-candidate-intent` **before any scoring**. Use concrete reasons.

1. **PR gate** — a pull request exists against the **designated assignment repository** (not only a standalone repo, email artifact, or private demo). Missing → `Failed`.
2. **Runtime gate (absolute, deployed only)** — the runtime must be a **candidate-deployed, hosted runtime** you can reach and exercise **without building, installing, or running the app yourself**, and you must be able to both reach **and** meaningfully exercise it. A **locally set-up app does not count**: `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`, a dev server you must start (`npm run dev`, `vite`, `docker compose up`), local Docker, "clone and run it locally", or a tunnel that merely exposes the candidate's machine are all **0/100, verdict Fail** — never run or host the app yourself to create a runtime. **Decide deployed-vs-local first:** a URL containing `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `[::1]`, a private-LAN IP (`10.*`, `192.168.*`, `172.16–31.*`), a bare `host:port` reached via setup/build steps, or any URL you constructed by running the repo is local-only → **0/100/Fail**. Do **not** *derive* or *infer* a runtime URL from the PR's local run instructions ("Runtime URL derived from PR: http://localhost:..." is a `Failed` runtime gate, never a pass); the candidate must have published a live, hosted deployment URL. If you cannot reach and exercise the deployed runtime, the result is **0/100, verdict Fail** — for **any** reason: no deployed runtime, a local-only app, an inaccessible or erroring URL, a login/OAuth you cannot complete, missing or non-working credentials, an automation/anti-bot block, a paywall, or anything else. This applies even when the cause is the evaluation environment, not the candidate. Reviewing the code and concluding "it would probably work" is **0**. Running it locally yourself is **0**. An API/MCP surface responding is **0** unless that surface alone fully demonstrates the core intent the candidate was asked to deliver.
3. **Credentials gate** — required credentials present and working, or the runtime is public. Missing → `Failed` (or `Blocked` if the operator may still supply them).
4. **Demo gate** — a demo artifact is present and reachable. Missing → `Failed` or `Blocked`.

Resolution rules:

- A `Failed` gate forces the overall score to **0** and the verdict to **Fail**. Stop scoring.
- **Runtime is absolute and must be deployed.** Before declaring the deployed runtime unreachable, make **one** recovery attempt: re-read the PR/submission for a deployed URL or credentials, then request operator help (Step 3) — ask for working credentials, a completed login, or the deployed runtime URL/client needed (never ask the operator to run or host the app for you). A local-only app or "run it locally" instructions are not a recovery path — they fail the gate. If after that attempt you still cannot exercise the deployed runtime, the result is **0/100, verdict Fail**. Do **not** mark the runtime `Blocked` and continue scoring, do **not** average other dimensions, and do **not** return `Partial Pass` or `Inconclusive`. An unexercised or local-only runtime is a 0 regardless of cause.
- `Blocked` (with an `Inconclusive` result for the affected area) is permitted only for a **non-runtime** check (e.g., a secondary artifact) and only when the runtime itself was successfully exercised and the intent proven.
- For non-runtime gates, distinguish a candidate omission (`Failed`) from an evaluation-environment blocker (`Blocked`). Never penalize the candidate for a non-runtime blocker you could have asked the operator to resolve.

## Step 2 — Prove the Outcome by Exercising the Runtime (Most Important)

Drive the live **deployed** runtime as a real user with the Playwright browser (`user-playwright` MCP tools: `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_fill`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_evaluate`, and the rest). Do not build, install, or run the candidate's app yourself — exercise only the hosted runtime they deployed.

- Walk the **primary workflow end to end** — the journey that delivers the intent.
- Gather the four evidence types the story implies: **working runtime behavior**, **data evidence** (records actually present and used), **output evidence** (what the product produces), and **demo artifacts** (does the demo show the real outcome).
- Capture for every check: URL/route, action taken, expected result, actual result, and a screenshot or extracted DOM/text.
- Prefer observed behavior over claims. Never credit a feature you could not make happen in the runtime.
- Stay read-only on candidate data where possible; avoid destructive actions unless the workflow requires it and the operator allows it.

## Step 3 — Ask the Operator for Access or Tools When the Browser Is Not Enough

When the Playwright browser alone cannot reach or exercise the runtime, **ask the operator** before declaring a block. Request when the product needs credentials/OAuth/one-time codes, a native/desktop/CLI/API client, test data or a sandbox, or network access (VPN/allow-list).

State: the capability and why the intent needs it; the exact action the operator should take **against the candidate's deployed runtime** (provide the hosted URL, working credentials, or a completed login — not run or host the app for you); the minimum scopes; a warning not to paste secrets into chat; and what to report back so you can resume. If the operator cannot unblock it, mark the affected checks `Blocked` — except that an unreachable or local-only **runtime** is never `Blocked`, it is the absolute 0/Fail from Step 1.

## Step 4 — Score Each Functional Evaluation Point (Most Important)

Do **not** produce one opaque functional-outcome number. Score every **evaluation point** from the Functional Outcome Breakdown in `evaluate-candidate-intent` individually, from real runtime use.

1. For **each evaluation point**, exercise the runtime to confirm it, then assign an anchored band (0/25/50/75/100%). `Points = band × the point's sub-weight`, rounded. Cite the observed action → result (and a screenshot/DOM) for each point.
2. The **Functional outcome subtotal = the sum of all evaluation-point scores** (max 40). This is the most important judgment in the evaluation.
3. Score **data scale** within the point(s) it belongs to (e.g., a coverage/scale point): a product populated with only a handful of rows/records/entities is a toy and that point must score **extremely low**, regardless of UI or code polish. Record observed counts and variety.
4. Separately score **evidence quality** (weight 12): how convincingly runtime/data/output/demo evidence proves the points (strong/observed vs thin/asserted).
5. Apply **anti-checklist** judgment: a submission that satisfies many technical bullets but misses the points that carry the intent gets a low functional score with an explicit explanation.
6. If a point cannot be exercised because the **runtime as a whole** was unreachable, the runtime gate already forced 0/Fail (Step 1) — do not score points. A single point you could not reach while the rest of the runtime works is that point scoring 0 with the reason, not a global gate fail.

## Step 5 — Access-Boundary Compliance

Check the assignment-specific access boundaries from `evaluate-candidate-intent` and `reference/assignment-evidence-catalogs.md`.

- For **X Engagement**, verify the submission uses the **hosted investors-mcp read tools** and flag any **direct database, vector-store, or blob access** as a violation.
- Confirm required external dependencies are used through the intended interface, not bypassed.
- Score access-boundary compliance and cite the evidence (config, network calls, code paths, runtime behavior).

## Step 6 — Acceptance Criteria as Evidence Probes

Walk each material acceptance criterion and assign `Pass`, `Partial`, `Fail`, or `Blocked`, each backed by an observed action/result with a link or observation. Treat criteria as evidence for the outcome, not as a substitute for it.

## Step 7 — Runtime/Demo Quality and Reproducibility

- **Runtime & demo quality**: stability, responsiveness, error handling observed during the run, and whether the demo artifact actually shows the real outcome.
- **Reproducibility**: whether the runtime and key results can be reached and reproduced from the **pull request as the system of record** (setup docs, working URL/creds, demo) without side-channel context.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Candidate Product — Evidence & Functional Evaluation

## Gate Result
<Pass | Failed: which gate + reason (score 0/100, verdict Fail, stop) | Runtime not exercised: reason (score 0/100, verdict Fail, stop) | Blocked: non-runtime check + reason>

## Outcome Proven?
<Yes | Partially | No> — <one line from real use>

## Functional Outcome — Per-Point Scores
| Evaluation point | Sub-weight | Band | Points | Evidence (action → result) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <point> | n | <%> | n | <observed> |
| **Functional outcome subtotal** | **40** | | **n** | |

## Evidence
- Runtime behavior / Data evidence (counts) / Output evidence / Demo artifact

## Access-Boundary Compliance
<compliant / violations with evidence>

## Acceptance Criteria
| Criterion | Status | Evidence (action → result / link) |
|---|---|---|

## Runtime/Demo Quality & Reproducibility
<observations>

## Dimension Subtotals
Emit a table for the dimensions this phase owns so the orchestrator can assemble the full scorecard. `Band` is the anchored fraction (0/25/50/75/100%); `Points` = Band × Weight, rounded.

| Dimension | Weight | Band | Points | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Functional outcome | 40 | — | n | sum of per-point scores (see Per-Point Scores) |
| Runtime & demo quality | 20 | <%> | n | <one line> |
| Evidence quality | 12 | <%> | n | <one line> |
| Access-boundary compliance | 8 | <%> | n | <one line> |
| Reproducibility | 4 | <%> | n | <one line> |

If a gate failed or the runtime was not exercised, set every Band to 0 / Points to 0 and state the gate cause in the Why column.
```

## Quality Bar

- Gates first; a `Failed` gate produces 0 and stops the phase.
- The runtime gate is absolute and deployed-only: a non-deployed/local-only app or a runtime you could not exercise yields 0/100 and Fail, for any reason, after one operator-assisted attempt — never a partial score or `Inconclusive`, and never run the app yourself to pass it.
- The outcome judgment is grounded in a Playwright-driven run of the live deployed runtime.
- Functional outcome is scored per evaluation point (Per-Point Scores table), and the subtotal is the sum of those points — never one opaque number.
- Functional outcome is evaluated before implementation; toy data scores extremely low.
- Access boundaries are checked with assignment-specific rules and cited evidence.
- Operator help is requested before declaring a block; Failed vs Blocked is distinguished.
- Every criterion status cites an observed action/result, not a documentation claim.
