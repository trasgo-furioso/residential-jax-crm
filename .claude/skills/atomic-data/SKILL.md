# Atomic Data Metrics

Use this skill when integrating **third-party contact-center or operational platforms** where you must preserve **auditability**: explain metrics from **atomic facts** where possible, use **vendor rollups** where necessary, store **pipeline-owned analytics as partitioned Parquet**, publish **lexicon-registered CloudWatch** metrics, and keep **one clear lineage** per KPI in the org lexicon.

This skill **specializes** the general [`metrics-skill`](../metrics-skill/) workflow for **atomic + rollup** data models. Follow the mandatory chain below.

## Related Skills

| Kind | Skill | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mandatory | [`metrics-skill`](../metrics-skill/) | End-to-end metrics definition, pipeline, dashboard, and delivery gates. |
| Mandatory | [`build-batch-workflows`](../build-batch-workflows/) | Step Functions, Glue, batch transforms, idempotency, cost gate, and batch metrics emission. |
| Often | [`apply-engineering-guidelines`](../apply-engineering-guidelines/) | TypeScript/Lambda/Glue standards, observability, testing. |
| Optional | [`build-ai-agents`](../build-ai-agents/) | Only when packaging this workflow as a **deployed** agent runtime (Asana, webhooks, ToolLoopAgent). Not required for pipeline-only work. |

## Mandatory Execution Chain

Always follow this order. Do not skip a gate.

1. **Repository understanding** — metrics pipeline repo, ETL repo, lexicon repo, dashboard repo (see [`rules/01-repo-and-layering.md`](./rules/01-repo-and-layering.md)).
2. **Lexicon / CloudWatch gate** — confirm or define metrics in lexicon workflows before code or dashboard wiring (see [`rules/02-lexicon-gates.md`](./rules/02-lexicon-gates.md)).
3. **Data integration** — atomic path vs vendor rollup path, Parquet layout, batch strategy (see [`rules/03-parquet-batch-and-emission.md`](./rules/03-parquet-batch-and-emission.md)).
4. **Reconciliation and classification** — overlap KPIs, direction rules, tolerances (see [`rules/04-reconciliation-and-rules.md`](./rules/04-reconciliation-and-rules.md)).
5. **Delivery** — metrics inventory, dashboard contract, tests, PRs — defer to `metrics-skill` delivery phase when coordinating repos.

## Hard Gates

- Do not implement pipeline or dashboard changes until **lexicon implications** are confirmed (reuse vs new entries in `cloudwatch-metrics.json` / `lexicon.json` as applicable).
- Do not invent canonical metric names without going through **`metrics-skill`** lexicon phase.
- Do not treat vendor field names as interchangeable with canonical names until mappings are explicit.
- Prefer **Parquet-only** analytics outputs under `derived/<vendor>/...`; do not maintain parallel JSON artifacts for analytics (see rules).

## Plan Artifact: Per-Agent Metrics Analysis

When the user asks for a structured plan, produce **Per-agent metrics analysis** with at least:

- Agent daily report **atomic validation matrix** (which KPIs are fact-backed vs rollup-only).
- Inbound/outbound derivation from daily call facts (tenant-wide vs service-scoped where required).
- **Parquet storage diagram** (blob/rollup layer vs atomic layer, partitions).
- **Proposed lexicon metrics** for agent KPIs (grain, source, unit).
- Gaps, assumptions, risks.
- Per-agent / per-day: what atomic data unlocks.

Details: [`rules/05-plan-artifact-per-agent-metrics.md`](./rules/05-plan-artifact-per-agent-metrics.md).
