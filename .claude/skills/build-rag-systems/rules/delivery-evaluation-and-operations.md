# Evaluation And Operations

Run the required replay path before relying on retrieval in production.

The path is fixed: SAM local plus Docker OpenSearch replay, AWS replay against the same contracts, shadow mode, suggest-only mode, limited auto-accept canary, then monitored automation. Do not skip ahead.

## Golden Sets

Create representative fixtures:

- queries or incoming objects
- expected retrieved records
- expected final decision
- acceptable alternatives
- rejection cases
- ambiguous cases
- tenant and metadata boundary cases

For header mapping, include common aliases, misspellings, acronyms, partner-specific labels, misleading near-matches, and low-confidence unknowns.

## Metrics

Track:

- top-k recall
- precision at accepted threshold
- false accept rate
- false reject rate
- review rate
- correction rate
- no-match rate
- latency
- embedding and search cost
- corpus freshness
- drift by source, partner, or tenant

For runtime automation, false accepts are usually more expensive than review volume. Optimize thresholds accordingly.

## Calibration

Calibrate thresholds by replaying historical examples.

Report:

- score distribution by correct and incorrect matches
- threshold candidates
- expected auto-accept rate
- expected manual-review rate
- known failure modes

Do not promote thresholds from a tiny sample without labeling them experimental.

## Observability

Log structured retrieval traces without leaking sensitive text:

- query ID or input hash
- filters applied
- candidate IDs
- scores
- selected threshold band
- final action
- model and embedding versions
- latency and cost

Store sensitive evidence in encrypted stores and log pointers instead of raw content.

## Rollout

Use this rollout:

1. SAM local plus Docker OpenSearch replay
2. AWS replay against a small corpus
3. shadow mode
4. suggest-only mode
5. limited auto-accept canary
6. full automation with monitoring

Keep a disable flag for retrieval-backed automation. Preserve deterministic fallback or manual review.

## SAM Local And Docker OpenSearch Replay

Before AWS deployment, run local replay through SAM local and Docker OpenSearch.

Run:

```bash
npx cdk synth
docker compose up opensearch
<seed-local-opensearch-command>
sam local invoke -t cdk.out/<Stack>.template.json <FunctionLogicalId> -e fixtures/rag/queries/<case>.json
```

Verify:

- fixture ingestion uses the production corpus schema
- local OpenSearch index mappings match the production query shape as closely as practical
- local OpenSearch is seeded from `fixtures/rag/corpus/*.jsonl`
- OpenSearch retrieval returns expected record IDs
- thresholds produce expected accept/review/reject decisions
- review corrections persist through the JSONL adapter
- agent/tool invocation uses the same request and response contracts

SAM local and Docker OpenSearch validate Lambda event handling, handler packaging, fixture ingestion, and retrieval behavior. They do not validate IAM, AWS quotas, or managed AWS service behavior.

## AWS Replay

After AWS deployment, replay the same golden cases through AWS adapters:

- Bedrock embedding calls use the production embedding service
- S3 source artifacts resolve through production object contracts
- DynamoDB metadata and review writes use the production table contract
- OpenSearch retrieval returns acceptable record IDs
- final decisions match local expectations or produce a documented mismatch

Compare retrieved IDs, threshold bands, and final decisions. Do not compare raw vector scores.

## Drift Checks

Monitor:

- new headers or schemas not seen before
- source-specific correction spikes
- score distribution shifts
- embedding model changes
- corpus growth or stale records
- metadata filter misses

Schedule re-evaluation after embedding model, chunking, normalization, or threshold changes.
